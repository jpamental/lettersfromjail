              <h1>Letters From Jail #10</h1>

            <h2>October 7, 1986</h2>
			<p>“You can’t have these stamps,” the guard said to Phil. He’d just opened the letter and shook out the loose stamps.</p>
			<p>“My wife sent them,” Phil said helplessly.</p>
			<p>“Well, you can’t have them,” the guard said, unsympathetically. “They’re not allowed.” He pushed the envelope and accompanying letter through the door. Phil stared at him. “They’ll go in your property. You can have them when you get out.”</p>
			<p>“Sure,” Phil said. “Lotta good they’ll do me then!” But the guard had turned away and didn’t hear him – nor care.</p>
			<p>“Shit,” I said. “I asked my mother to send me some 17 cent stamps – for when I go over an ounce.”</p>
			<p>“They’re not all like that, man,” Mike said. “He’s a real asshole. Some of them don’t care.”</p>
			<p>“Why the fuck should they care?” Phil asked, looking more and more angry as realization sank in.</p>
			<p>“They’re worried about drugs,” Mike said. “They think them stamps might have something like acid on their backs. That’s why they take the stamps off the letters you get.” (I’d noticed about a quarter of the letters I got were missing their stamps, but I’d assumed that was because some guard was stealing them.) “It’s an easy way to smuggle in a hit or two of blotter (LSD),” Mike added.</p>
			<p>“I seen on the television where they got this test,” Chester said. “They put a cigarette in a glass of water, and if it swells up, it’s got dope in it. Thass why they don’t let you bring no cigarettes in here wit’cha.”</p>
			<p>“I dunno,” I said. “Guys in GH-2 when I was down there had their own cigarettes they’d brought in.”</p>
			<p>“No, sir,” Chester insisted. “They don’t let you bring in no cigarettes – might have dope in them.”</p>
			<p>“You telling me I didn’t see any cigarettes in GH-2?” I asked.</p>
			<p>“Thass right,” Chester said. “They ain’t gonna let you bring no cigarettes in. They search you, man.”</p>
			<p>“They used to do that, but not any more,” Mike said quietly. “They let me bring in my cigarettes.”</p>
			<p>“No, sir, they don’t allow it,” Chester said, as though Mike had not spoken. “They got this test.”</p>
			<p>I snorted. “Great,” I said. “And if your cigarette passes the test, you’ve got a ruined cigarette.”</p>
			<p>“It’s a test, man,” Chester said. “Saw it on TV.”</p>
			<p>“Sure you did,” I said. “What is it a test for?”</p>
			<p>“Dope, man,” said the 57-year-old black man, who had never smoked any drug but nicotine.</p>
			<p>“What kind of dope?” I persisted. “Marijuana, PCP, what?”</p>
			<p>“I dunno – just dope. It swells up. They take the tobacco out and put the dope in, then they put a little tobacco back in the ends. Doncha know nothing?”</p>
			<p>“I know this much,” I said. “I know marijuana doesn’t swell up. Neither does parsley – that’s what they put PCP on.”</p>
			<p>“I’m talking ’bout reefer, man,” Chester said. “You don’t know nuthin’.”</p>
			<p>“I know a fuck lot more about that shit than you do,” I said, getting angry. “What do you think I’m in here for?”</p>
			<p>“You don’t know nuthin’,” Chester repeated, adamantly. “I saw that test on TV!”</p>
			<p>“You believe everything you see on TV?” I asked, sarcastically.</p>
			<p>“Thass right,” Chester said, “I do. They don’t lie on TV. I believe them before I believe you.” His voice dripped with scorn.</p>
			<p>I shook my head. “Okay,” I said, shrugging my shoulders. “You believe the fucking TV. Stay stupid.”</p>
			<p>Chester laughed derisively. “You stupid,” he said. He shook his head in disbelief. “Man don’t believe the TV,” he said. He knew who was the fool.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>I have never before had to deal with real stupidity. Some of the other guys in here are not real bright, and have problems spelling or doing arithmetic, but they’re not stupid. They have their own areas of cleverness, of quick-wittedness. Lonny may not spell well, but he plays cards well. Mike and Phil both read a fair amount – I pass along books to them – and most of us peruse the paper each weekday. Wayne, when he was here (he may have gotten out today – no one knows for sure) asked me to go over his homework with him (and had most of his answers right).</p>
			<p>Chester doesn’t read. He doesn’t play cards. He sits and watches TV. Apparently he thinks it’s all Real.</p>
			<p>The other evening, a guard stuck a receipt through the door. It was marked “A-7” and indicated that money had been credited to a commissary account. Mike, Chester, and I looked at it. (It was evening, and everyone else was napping.) Neither of the names on the receipt – the donor, nor the recipient – was familiar to us. Mike and I saw this at first glance.</p>
			<p>“Who this for?” Chester asked, puzzling over the slip of paper.</p>
			<p>“It’s for (So&amp;so),” I said. (I have forgotten the actual names involved.)</p>
			<p>“Which one he is?” Chester asked.</p>
			<p>“No one in here,” Mike said.</p>
			<p>“He that guy in A-cell?” Chester asked.</p>
			<p>“No,” I said, “that’s Jackson.”</p>
			<p>“What about the guy in B?” Chester asked.</p>
			<p>“That’s Phil,” Mike said.</p>
			<p>“Phil? Whass his last name?” Chester asked.</p>
			<p>“Funk,” Mike said.</p>
			<p>“Huh?” Chester said. “This for him?”</p>
			<p>“No,” I said, “This is for (So&amp;so).”</p>
			<p>“Maybe it for Bill,” Chester said. Bill Leamy had come in the same night as Chester. </p>
			<p>“Nah,” Mike said. “They got it wrong. It’s somebody in another cellblock.”</p>
			<p>Chester continued to look at the receipt. He shook his head. “It ain’t for neither of you?”</p>
			<p>“No,” I said. “Give it here.” I took the slip and wrote across its end in pencil, “Not A-7.”</p>
			<p>“What are you doing that for?” Chester asked. </p>
			<p>Without answering him, I stood up and took the slip back to the door and stuck it through the space between the door and the doorjamb – the place through which we stick commissary orders and Request forms.</p>
			<p>“What you doin’, man?” Chester asked.</p>
			<p>Mike explained what I had done.</p>
			<p>A passing guard took the slip moments later, and perhaps even found the correct cellblock for it. Half an hour later Chester looked up and noticed the slip was gone. “That paper’s gone,” he said. And then, another half hour after that, he looked up again and exclaimed, “The paper’s gone – they done took it.” Mike and I just looked at each other.</p>
			<p>This sort of thing could get on my nerves.</p>
