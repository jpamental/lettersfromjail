              <h1>Letters From Jail #13</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>October 5, 1986</h2>
			<p>The Saga Continues: today I received a Communication from Above. Namely, a response to a Request Form I’d filed on October 7th. I’d asked why I had not yet been “classified” by the state, as I’d been told I would be within a month or so after my entrance to this durance vile. More precisely, I’d written, “I would like to know my classification by the state. I have been here for more than one month.”</p>
			<p>Today, in lieu of Real Mail, the deputy distributing the mail returned my Request Form. Scrawled down the right side was the following message: “You will not be classified by the State on 1 year sentence is Mandatory Parole after you’ve served at least 91 days in jail” (all totally sic).</p>
			<p>I checked the handy calendar stuck in the phone (courtesy the Fairfax County Jail Ministry) and counted off the days. December 6th. Could I be released then? Dare I hope? What does “at least” mean in this context? Illiteracy? Or does it have to do with “Good Time” (or, conversely, infractions – like fighting – which might add time)? If this is true, it means I’ve served almost half my time in here already. I’d certainly love to be Out before Christmas, but I’ve been on this emotional roller coaster before; part of me remains skeptical. We shall see....</p>

			<p>Last night we became seven again. Around 9:30 PM they brought in Jack Urban. He’s here on a DWI – and claims he was arrested (in Falls Church) in a 7-11 parking lot while sitting in a parked van. He’s here in lieu of a $5,000 bond, his court date not until late November. He appears typical of a kind of prisoner of which there are too many here: accused but not (yet) convicted of any crime, here because they can’t raise bond. Jack admits to a number of prior DWI charges, which no doubt is one reason his bond is this high (relatively speaking – mine was ten times greater).</p>
			<p>In appearance he is old and scuzzy – he looks like a wino, with the typical sunken cheeks and toothless jaws of a mouth that closes too far, bringing his chin too close to his nose. He’s small, wizened, and ratty looking. It came as a shock to me when I inquired his age and discovered he is one month younger than I am.<br /><br />It’s too early to know for sure, but he seems quiet and inoffensive. He talks little, doesn’t play cards much (none at all, yet, but he said he “used” to play Spades), and doesn’t seem to read. (I asked him if he read comics, and pointed to the stack I’d donated, but he’s yet to pick one up.) He has fit unobtrusively into things here, and I gather this is not his first stay in this jail. He’ll do.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>In Forensics Class today there were only three of us inmates: Red Bob, Dan, and me. The subject turned out to be cellblock behavior, and I began to realize just how lucky I am to be in A-7.</p>
			<p>Dan started by describing a (black) man in his cell who constantly pesters him for things – primarily cigarettes.</p>
			<p>“Now, I have lots of money in my account here,” he said, “and I get a couple of bags every time from commissary.” Commissary days are Tuesdays and Fridays. Our orders come in little paper bags. “And there’s two other guys who have money. But the other four guys don’t. They can’t spend more than maybe a buck or two a week.” (Cigarettes cost 90 cents a pack here, with no discount for cartons.) “So this one guy, he calls me ‘bourgeois,’ and he’s always hitting me up for cigarettes. All the time! And if I say no, he starts screaming at me about how I better not ever ask him for anything, ’cause he wouldn’t give it to me. Now, this is a guy I never have asked for anything, and it’s not likely I ever will, because he never has anything, anyway.</p>
			<p>“See, I’m a fairly generous guy. I give away a lot of cookies, candy, stuff like that. I’ll give a guy a cigarette lots of times – even a pack – but I expect a little back. Like, if I’m out, he’ll give me a smoke. But this particular guy, he never pays anyone back. He just pesters you until you give him what he wants. He threatens. I’m not intimidated” – Dan is a big guy – “but if I was maybe a lot smaller, I might be.”<br /></p>
			<p>At this point Chris Tull, the psychologist, pointed out that this is a classic behavior pattern. “If you put rats in a box where they have to push a button for a food pellet, and in some boxes each time the button is pushed the rat is rewarded with a pellet, and in other boxes the rat has to push three times for the pellet, which box do you think the rat goes to?” It turns out the rat chooses the box where it takes several pushes on the button.</p>
			<p>“Why?” I asked.&#9;</p>
			<p>“Good question,” Chris said, with a grin. “Apparently, having to push the button several times reinforces the behavior pattern. It’s the same way here. If you give the guy a cigarette every time he asks for one, he won’t ask as often as he will if he only gets one every three or four times he asks. By giving him a cigarette only once in a while, you teach him to pester you more.”</p>
			<p>“Well,” Dan said, “I cut him off. I didn’t give him any reasons or anything. I just said ‘no.’”</p>
			<p>“The way I deal with that” – cigarette cadging – Red Bob said, “is this:” and he pulled a pouch of rolling tobacco out of his shirt pocket. “It’s cheaper, and it cuts down on the requests.” </p>
			<p>I recall Lee Hoffman rolling her own in the Old Days of New York fandom. “It cuts down on your consumption, too,” I said, “when you have to roll one before you can smoke it.” </p>
			<p>Bob grinned: “Yeah – and sometimes just when you got it rolled, the paper tears and breaks, and you got tobacco all over the place.…</p>
			<p>“Thing is,” Bob said, “I used to buy cigarettes, but I found guys were going into my cell while I was in gym, and stealing them. So now there’s nothing to steal – they can’t be bothered with rolling their own.”</p>
			<p>From there we went on to general behavior. I recalled Teresa saying in a recent letter, “When I typed out the letters where you discussed Asshole Steve, I was first struck by how obnoxious you found him. Later on, after I’d digested it a bit, I went back and reread those passages to see again just exactly what it was about him. I wondered if I’d read it correctly the first time, mistaken minor nuisance for major nuisance. That’s when I realized that his behavior – simple assholery in the outside world – was inconsiderate squared and cubed in a situation where you can’t get away from him. I decided you’d been restrained in your appraisal….” I offered a boiled down version of that: “Here we are, seven guys in a cellblock, and you gotta get along. Everybody’s inside your personal space.”</p>
			<p>“Yeah,” Bob said, “we got one guy now, he acts like he’s living at home.” </p>
			<p>“What do you mean?” Chris asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, he just acts like we’re not there. He takes a shower, he stands out in the middle of the dayroom to towel off, getting water all over the place. He’ll get up and shower before breakfast while everyone else is trying to sleep” – showering is noisy – “and there he’ll be out on the floor, toweling off and blocking everyone from the food when they’re passing it in.” (Mattresses on the floor leave a limited space in the dayroom for maneuvering for breakfast.) “We’ll be sitting at the table, playing cards, and he’ll push his way in and sit down on the bench in front of the TV to watch something, instead of pulling up a chair – and he’s big, he weighs over 250 pounds, and he takes up a lotta space. He just pushes people out of his way.” Warming to the subject, Bob continued, “He leans right over the card game to change channels or turn up the sound. And then, he’ll go make a phone call and demand we turn the sound down. Hell, he’s so loud, you can’t hear the TV over him!” He grinned. “We just turn it up.”</p>
			<p>I thought about how considerate we generally are of each other here in A-7. When we’re playing cards we make sure we’re not blocking Chester’s view of the TV. We turn it down if someone’s on the phone and can’t hear. We ask each other what we want to see (I’ve established my priorities – I gave up St. Elsewhere on Wednesdays for NBC on Thursday nights, and LA Law on Friday nights, plus 60 Minutes on Sundays). We share cookies, candy, and – among those who smoke – cigarettes. (I bought Mike five packs of Kools one week – he paid me back in Hershey bars when he got some money a week later.) We kid each other, but with an underlying respect for each other that does not seem to be as common in the other cellblocks. Nobody begs, pesters, or threatens in here – now that Asshole Steve is gone. This is the best cellblock in the jail. I hope it stays that way.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Talking with the Nielsen Haydens tonight made me aware of something. I tend to write down (and thus externalize, and get off my chest) my gripes about the guys in here like Bill and Chester. What I don’t do is to offer subsequent write-ups of ameliorating behavior, or the modification of my feelings. That’s a disservice to them, Bill in particular. Bill has a fussiness that goes with his age and his New England background. He is also forgetful – forever forgetting who just dealt a hand of cards (even when it’s him). But his traits in this regard are only slight exaggerations of those shared by the rest of us. (Mike and I share the joke that it’s the absence of drugs that’s rotting our minds. “I’m gonna end up like Bill, I know it!”) And in consequence we kid Bill about his shortcomings but we rarely snap at him or get angry with him. And he responds with cheerfulness to this kidding. (It’s fascinating to watch Mike reveal considerable sensitivity in his judgment of just how far the kidding should go, and where it should stop.)</p>
			<p>Once, one morning, Bill called, “Lock-out, Mike,” into Mike’s cell (Mike inherited Lonny’s cell), and Mike came out and grumpily told Bill, “I don’t need to hear that from you, Bill.” But we’re all grumpy then, and it’s to Bill’s credit that he usually doesn’t need to be told twice. You get used to it. And Bill’s chirpiness is far from the worst behavior one could encounter in here, as the previous section of this Letter may have made clear. He means well. That counts for a lot in here.</p>
			<p>#<br /></p>
			<p>“I go out on clean-up detail in the evenings,” Dan remarked in Forensics Class today (in fact, I’d seen him last night at clean-up and exchanged a few friendly words with him), “and there’s this one deputy, he uses dice to decide how he deals with requests.”</p>
			<p>Deputies are routinely asked for Request Forms, or given Request Forms, or are asked for other things that range from requests to call attorneys from a free (non-collect-call) phone, to requests to get out into the hallway on a work detail. Sometimes they do as requested, but as often they don’t. (None of them responded to our requests for Request Forms for five days last week – a serious dereliction of duty on their part.)</p>
			<p>“I watched him,” Dan said. “He has this die, and he has three things written on it, ‘Yes,’ ‘No,’ and ‘Maybe.’ I watched him. When he was asked to do something, he’d roll the die. If it came up ‘Yes,’ he’d do it. ‘No,’ and he’d ignore it. If it was ‘Maybe,’ he’d wait a while, and then roll it again. I saw him read a Request Form, roll the die, see it come up ‘No,’ and wad the Request Form up and throw it away.”</p>
			<p>“They’re not supposed to do that,” Chris protested.</p>
			<p>“I saw him do it. I saw it with my own eyes, man,” Dan said. “He laughed to himself when he did it, too.”</p>
			<p>“Wotta asshole,” I said. Dan and Red Bob nodded in agreement. Chris looked unhappy.</p>
			<p>So it goes.</p>
