              <h1>Letters From Jail #8</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 15, 1986</h2>
			<p>This is the seventh ballpoint pen I’ve used in the nearly a month I’ve been here. Of such small frustrations is prison life fashioned. Each pen – two Papermates, three Keymids, and a Bic – runs “dry” after using between a quarter- and a half-inch of ink in its transparent plastic tube. Oddly enough, when you remove the basic part (a plastic tube filled with ink and attached to a metal point mounted in a brass-colored plastic surround), there is no visible difference between these three different brands. And there is no difference in performance, either – they all quit too soon. I’ve wondered if it was the paper I write on, increasingly damp from the excessive humidity, but each pen starts out writing in a clean, dark ink, and grows progressively lighter until every stratagem (taking the pen apart, blowing into the open end of the inner-ink tube, etc.) ultimately fails. Frustrating. A microcosmic example of life here.</p>
			<p>Today was not a good day. I was assured in my psych group today that I’d do the full four months until mandatory parole – “By the time they had a meeting with you and processed the paper work, it would be four months anyway” – which only sounds bad if you’ve been expecting less, and maybe hoping to be out by Thanksgiving, or Christmas at the latest. Oh well….</p>
			<p>According to a front-page article in The Fairfax Journal, “on a recent weekend, the 315-bed Fairfax jail held 567 inmates – the most in its history... As many as ten inmates have been crammed into jail cells built for five people.” I can attest to that. I understand that one reason is the large number of State prisoners (like myself) being housed in this County facility. And the reason for that is that the state pays the jail $70 a day for each state prisoner housed here – more than the county pays for county prisoners. Isn’t that delightful? I know they don’t spend more on us (my cellblock has both state and county prisoners and we’re all treated alike), nor does it add up to any $70 a day. “It’s all politics, man.”</p>
			<p>I’m enclosing the article with this Letter. The photo shows a typical cellblock dayroom. Ours is identical, but somewhat neater.</p>
			<p>Ten inmates at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center fill their minimum-security cell that should hold five inmates.</p>
			<p>They are building a new wing here, originally supposed to be open July 15th, and now expected to open in late December; the contractors are now paying daily penalties. Parts are being opened now – a new visitor’s facility is supposed to open this week – and we’ve heard air-hammers taking down old walls; the electricity in most circuits went off for a couple hours last week, forcing us into an early lock-in that night; and the fire-alarm bells have gone off at odd moments for over a week now.</p>
			<p>So it wasn’t surprising when the alarm bells went off again tonight, around 7 PM.</p>
			<p>I was lying in bed, reading Joseph Wambaugh’s The Choirboys (the truth about American police, as told by an ex-cop). The alarm went on and on – no less than five minutes, and maybe twice that. I heard someone yelling, “Fire! Fire!” and figured it was some wiseass down the hall. But after the alarm finally stopped, I happened to look out the (rather high on the wall) window, and saw at least three fire trucks outside, a hose snaking up to the building.</p>
			<p>There was no smell of smoke and no attempt to evacuate us, but, as I stood at our door, peering out into the hallway and the stairway up to B-level, I saw grimy-faced men in fire-fighting outfits coming down, and heard a guard tell someone else that someone – an inmate, I assume – was dead. It was curiously abstract and removed from us. I wonder if we’ll ever hear what actually occurred.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Wayne stops by outside our door when he can, to chat and cadge cigarettes. He is not enjoying being a Trusty. They work 16-hour days. “My feet are killing me,” he says. He’s working the kitchen detail, mostly scrubbing pots and pans, occasionally pouring the tin cups of “juice” for our lunch out in the hall. He misses our card games and wishes he was back in here, but hopes he’ll be getting Out soon.</p>
			<p>Lonny gets Out on October 12, and has papers to show it. Mike will get his cell. Jackson was finally sentenced in court today, and received 12 months. (That means County Time; if it was one year, it would be State Time.) When Lonny leaves, I’ll be third-senior here…I wonder if Wayne will be returned here, get Out, or stay a Trusty. I like the Big Guy, and would welcome his return.</p>
			<p>Sunday, I fixed Chester’s glasses. One temple-piece had come off – a screw had fallen out. I pulled a staple from a magazine (an overlooked item, heh-heh) and bent it into a wire that replaced the screw. He was very grateful, but not enough to let me watch St. Elsewhere on TV tonight – he was watching a Magnum rerun.</p>
			<p>I’m becoming annoyed by Bill. (He is, you’ll recall, 62 years old and in here for fraud.) He isn’t an asshole, like Steve Payne was (and Payne is still here, down the hall in A-9, despite his story that he needs only $65 to get out…) but he’s fussy and tends to do unwanted things which simply have to be undone afterward. I can’t dislike him for wanting to be helpful, but he gets on my nerves. He lacks “cool,” I guess. I’m afraid I’m soon going to start snapping at him (“I’ve already told you that!”), and that will mess up my “cool.” Plus, he tends to wander into my cell to look at what I’ve got in here, which Is Not Accepted. (In my psych group today, we discussed “personal space” and people who enter others’ cells uninvited, and how to deal with them.) I wonder what his “fraud” was – he says he can’t discuss it on advice of his attorney (“there are still some suits pending”) – if his fussy persona is a con-man’s front, I’ll probably never know.</p>

			<p>October 2, 1986</p>
			<p>Bang! Bang-bang-bang! Sometime before 5 AM the cell doors unlocked. Actually, I’d been awakened by the sounds of the cell-doors unlocking in A-6 – the sound through the back wall of my cell was almost as loud as it would be when ours were unlocked. I listened for the sounds in the hall. No dishes clattering yet … I dozed some more.</p>
			<p>“Chow time!” came Bill’s cheerful voice. “Chow time, guys!” Shit! They hadn’t even let down the little door that opened the slot in our cellblock door. They hadn’t yet banged loudly on the door with something metallic (keys? You can always tell the approach of a guard by his jangling keys…) and yelled out, “Breakfast!” Sometimes a half hour passes between the unlocking of the cells and the arrival of breakfast. But there was helpful old Bill trying to rouse us so we could sit around and wait for our food. I turned over and tried to remember what I’d been dreaming: something about living in an old (late ’20s) Packard roadster … something about living outdoors and how it would have to end soon when winter came … something about standing outside a building with lit windows, waiting for it to be opened – to serve breakfast?</p>
			<p>“Let’s go, guys!” Bill called. Fuck him! Officious turd! I could hear him clearing the table – although only two guys eat breakfast there, the rest of us waiting in our cells, Mike on the floor next to his mattress. Yes, I could get real tired of Bill.</p>
			<p>Soon enough – but at least half an hour after Bill’s first chirpy call – the slot-door slammed down. “Breakfast! Breakfast!” said the deputy, banging on the door. I pulled on my pants, and went out for my tray. I gave Mike the first one passed to me and took the second. “Want yer fruit today?” I asked Mike. It was mixed slices of orange and grapefruit. “Take half,” he said. “I’ll take half yer eggs!” He knew I never ate the “scrambled eggs” – “curdled rubber” would be a better description.</p>
			<p>I took my tray to my cell. By the time I came back out, the coffee had been brought in; I picked up the seven half-pints of milk, and passed them out as I headed to my cell. “Here’s your coffee, Ted,” Bill said. “I don’t drink that stuff,” I told him for the seventh straight day in a row.</p>
			<p>I put the jelly on my toast and tried to open the milk carton. This was one of the ones that didn’t want to open – I had to tear it open, making a torn spout that would dribble down my chin if I wasn’t careful. I alternated sips of milk with spoonfuls of fruit and bites of toast. I scraped the remaining egg off into my toilet, and pissed on it. After I’d taken my tray and milk carton to the door (they count the empty milk cartons and plastic spoons – never know what you might use to hang yourself), I brushed my teeth, pulled my cell door shut, and went back to bed, for a few more hours of sleep.</p>
			<p>A little after 8:40, the guard came by to announce lock-out. I had my stuff ready, dressed, and moved everything I expected to need during the day out into the dayroom. Bill was lying on his mattress, dozing. Since his mattress goes in my cell during the day, I had to wait for him before I could close my door, unload the stuff off my chair, and sit down in front of my cell door. He gave no sign of waking and rising. I wanted to shout, “Chow time, Bill!” in his ear, but I didn’t. I don’t kick puppies, either.</p>
			<p>Mornings are silent times. No one wants to be awake. We sit silently, reading that cruddy newspaper, The Fairfax Journal (nothing in it about last night’s fire – it’s not a real newspaper), or just waiting for the TV to come on and, at 9 AM, Love Connection. Sullenness hangs in the air. I picked up The Choirboys, nearly finished the night before, and waded back into it. Heavy stuff: despite the absolute scumminess of the protagonist cops, what happens to them in the final chapters was getting to me. Existential police fiction. Just the thing to read in here.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Lonny and I went up to gym, looking for Wayne, but Wayne didn’t show. Red Bob was there, and told me Bob the ex-psychologist was getting Out today or tomorrow. “He’s getting real impatient,” Red Bob said.</p>
			<p>Wayne came by later to our door, and showed us a new warrant that had been issued against him. He’d plea-bargained his counts down, but now the County was issuing warrants for the charges the State had agreed to drop. Shit. Typical. I guess he’ll be here a while yet. I hope he moves back in here when Lonny leaves. (If he doesn’t, someone else will….) </p>
			<p>They tried to deny me access to my remaining books in Property today. “You gotta get them direct from the publisher,” this old turkey of a deputy said smugly. “I did,” I said. He didn’t believe me until he’d looked at them. “How’d you get all these books?” he asked, shaking his head. But he let me exchange the five I’d originally pulled for five more.</p>
			<p>I’ve (hand)written less than six pages of this Letter. When I started, this pen was brand-new. Now the ink is light and getting fainter. Good thing I ordered two more from Commissary. I’ll need another pen by tomorrow.</p>
			<p>Shitty jail; shitty pens.</p>
			<p>So it goes.</p>
