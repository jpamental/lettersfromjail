            <h2>October 18, 1986</h2>
			<p><br />One of the best things about living in New York City in 1979 and 1980, while I was editing Heavy Metal, was the music.</p>
			<p>I’d hired Lou Stathis as HM’s rock (“rok”) columnist, and together – and occasionally with Dan Steffan, when he started working in the art department – we’d hit the various nightspots in the city. New York was unique in my experience for the fact that even on weekday nights the music in most of the rock clubs started around midnight and lasted until four or five in the morning. I don’t know when this tradition was established – in the fifties and sixties when I was hitting the jazz clubs the set started much earlier and ended no more than an hour or two after midnight – since I was absent from the scene for nearly 20 years, but even with an 11 AM arrival time at my office, I often ran very short on sleep.</p>
			<p>My favorite club was Hurrah, located a few blocks away from Lincoln Center, on the Upper West Side. You climbed a ratty stairway up several dingy flights and suddenly found yourself in a vast room with mirrored walls, a large bar, a lounge with carpeted seats, a big dance floor, and a small bandstand flanked by TV monitors. It was here that I saw for the first time most of the premier British New Wave bands like XTC, Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark, and Ultravox right after Midge Ure joined, as well as lesser, but quirky, bands like the Slits. It was here that my mind was blown by Kid Creole and the Coconauts, and here that I saw Suicide and Lydia Lunch and James Chance’s James White &amp; the Blacks. And here that I saw, met, and became friends with Nash the Slash, the one-man band whom I wrote up myself in HM. I spent New Year’s Eve at Hurrah with Nash, several of the Talking Heads, and Walt O’Brien (Now with IMPortant Records). </p>
			<p>The person who made my frequent forays to Hurrah possible was the club’s booking agent, Ruth Polsky. Not only did she book in so many of the bands that I wanted to see (making frequent trips overseas to catch new bands before they were even heard of here), she was always willing to put me on the guest list whenever I called – often only the afternoon before. I’m sure my HM connection was a major factor, but once she knew me – and especially after my write-up of Nash appeared – our relationship became more personal and friendly. I liked her taste in music, and I liked her. </p>
			<p>I lost track of her when I left HM and NYC in August 1980. Hurrah, I heard, closed in 1981. Ruth’s name appeared from time to time in the rock press as a booking agent for other clubs. </p>
			<p>But I was totally unprepared for her obituary which appeared in the October 23rd issue of Rolling Stone, which I snagged from the rolling library cart here yesterday afternoon. She was “run down by a taxi while she was standing outside the Limelight, a desanctified church turned nightclub in Manhattan,” on September 7th. She was 32.</p>
			<p>Shit.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>October 19, 1986</p>
			<p>Sometimes they let you sleep and sometimes they don’t. For two nights now they haven’t. The night before last the guard who routinely came into our cellblock to shine his flashlight into our eyes slammed the door loudly on his way out. “Hell,” Jack said. “How’s a man to sleep through that every fifteen minutes?”</p>
			<p>Last night was worse. Minutes after the one guard conducted lock-in, another unlocked the cells from outside with the characteristic bang-bang-bang-bang! of gunshots (amplified within each cell by the confined concrete-walled space), did it again, and then came in and pulled open each door and shut it again, automatically relocking them. I was still awake, but Mike, Phil, and Jackson had been sleeping. I heard Mike’s querulous “What’s wrong with you, man?” from the next (D) cell. The next few passes through were relatively uneventful, but for the flashlight beam in my eyes. But somewhere around an hour before breakfast a flat-topped guard came through and unlocked each of our cell doors with a key and then slammed it shut again. Why? Who knows? Maybe just simple sadism. Maybe boredom. Is it worth complaining about? Probably not.</p>
			<p>Every time I get to thinking, “This isn’t so bad. I can get along here,” something mindless like this occurs. Simple bullying – reminders that this is supposed to be punishment, and loss of regular sleep is punishing in many ways, both subtle and overt.</p>
