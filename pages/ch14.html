			<p>You could hear it coming, from way down the hall. </p>
			<p>Bang-bang-bang-bang! “A-5! Gym in fifteen minutes! Gym at 7:30!” </p>
			<p>Bang-bang-bang-bang! “A-6! Gym in fifteen minutes! Gym at 7:30!” </p>
			<p>BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG! “A-7! Gym in ten minutes! 7:30! Gym at 7:30!” The gym director, Trusty, or whoever it was, was banging something metal and loud on the doors, then shouting his message through the door slots as though heralding the Apocalypse.</p>
			<p>“Get stuffed!” I shouted back at him through my cell door. Who needs to have his remaining sleep defiled this way? And who wants to go up to the gym at 7:30 in the morning, anyway?</p>
			<p>Bang-bang-bang-bang! “A-8! Gym call! Gym in ten minutes!”</p>
			<p>Bang-bang-bang-bang! “A-9! Gym at 7:30! Gym in ten minutes!”</p>
			<p>Gym is located one flight up, adjacent to the classrooms, and flanked by the “B” cells on the west side, and the “C” cells on the east, their windows overlooking the volleyball court. Gym consists of the “outdoor” volleyball court, its two-storey walls topped with a steel mesh “roof” through which both sunshine and rain can fall, but with few other aspects of the outdoors; plus an indoor half-court for basketball, and a run-down “weight room.” The latter contains some workout equipment and a broken standing scale. Some guys go up there every day, but I do so rarely, usually to stand around and visit with someone, or to breathe fresh air. I skipped it today.</p>

			<p>“It is the oldest story in history. For a brief period a community existed of the appropriate size to stage its quarrels, create its consensus and express its needs with confidence, energy, and grace. Then, in pursuing its Manifest Destiny, the community outgrew itself – and fragmented.” </p>
			<p>– Melvin Maddocks, describing the history of Harvard University in Smithsonian, September 1986</p>
			<p>As fandom goes, so....</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>We’ve been hearing for weeks about the new visitation area, which is in the New Wing of the jail and has been Just About To Open since September 22nd. </p>
			<p>Today – October 16th – it opened.</p>
			<p>Today Dan Steffan brought Greg Pickersgill to visit me here.</p>
			<p>“White! Visitation!” the guard said, at about 7:30. “Take that pen out of your pocket,” he added. “Leave it here.” The last time I had a visitor I was told to wear my crummy blue short sleeved “uniform” shirt over the long sleeved sweatshirt I was wearing, and on this occasion I had a pen in my shirt pocket.</p>
			<p>As I headed out my cellblock door the guard said, “You’re gonna get to use the new visitation area today. It’s just been opened.”</p>
			<p>“Where’s it at?” I asked.</p>
			<p>“Just go upstairs and turn to your right. The deputy in the hall will escort you.”</p>
			<p>I went up the same stairs I take to class or the gym, but turned right instead of left, entering the B-section hallway which is directly above the hallway outside our cellblock. There I found a guard who sent me down the hall to another guard who was standing where the hall took a slight bend. At that point it became part of the new wing, the paint very fresh and new.</p>
			<p>There I stood and waited for ten minutes while other inmates joined me. (One was just made Trusty that day. We talked about that.)</p>
			<p>Then the guard (an Asian with a Germanic name) read off our cubicle numbers and led us into the new area. As we entered, inmates concluding their visits exited past us. “It’s no good, man,” one said as he passed us. Soon we understood what he meant.</p>
			<p>The old area was subdivided into cubicles with walls that extended perhaps four feet into the room. The cubicles in the new area are partitioned off from each other with little barriers that extend out no more than one foot.</p>
			<p>The old cubicles had swivel-chairs bolted to the floor on the inmates’ side and ordinary chairs (like the ones in our cells) on the visitors’ side. The new cubicles have concrete pedestals – hard, fixed, and backless – on both sides.</p>
			<p>And, most important, the old cubicles had telephones to talk through, while the new cubicles have tiny grilled apertures under the windows to talk through.</p>
			<p>We filed in, sat at our assigned cubicles, and looked at each other. There was much less privacy – no real isolation from each other. “We gonna have to keep our voices down,” one guy said. “Shit, man, I don’t like this at all,” another said. I had to agree.</p>
			<p>We waited another five or ten minutes and our visitors came in. Mine were Dan and Greg. Dan had visited me before, and was aware of the change.</p>
			<p>It was all new, of course, to Greg.</p>
			<p>We tried to talk. It was not impossible, just difficult. The one speaking had to put his mouth close to the grill, while the listener had his ear to his side of the grill. Soon, both the inmates’ side and the visitor’ side were filled with raised voices, and it was even more difficult to hear or be understood.</p>
			<p>I held my Request Form with the message that I had a total of “at least 91 days” to serve up against the glass so they could read it. Then we attempted conversation. It wasn’t easy on either side. We quickly realized that it was pointless to get into any extended conversation and arranged for me to call the Steffan house the next day after lunch (around 11:30 AM), to talk with Greg at greater length. Then we filled in our remaining time with pantomime and grins.</p>
			<p>My impression is that Dan and Greg had been at the Vietnam Memorial, and the Smithsonian Air &amp; Space Museum that afternoon, and planned to go to the Science &amp; Technology Museum tomorrow. Greg said he’d found a lot to enjoy here, and wanted to come back, lamenting as I have the distance and expense that separate our respective countries. It was frustrating to try to talk – we had a lot we each wanted to say, and the new cubicles made it so difficult.</p>
			<p>Although the new visitation area has 32 separate cubicles, in several rows in a large room, most were not in use, and we were still allowed only about 20 minutes (and the visitors still had to wait until the first group had come out before being let in). That made as little sense as the design of the new area itself did. But I’ve given up expecting the people who run this jail to do things for logical or sensible reasons. The new visitation area is Kafkaesque in design and execution – a new form of punishment for both us and our visitors.</p>
			<p>As we filed out, the men were disgusted. “My mother came 600 miles, man, and she couldn’t hear a word I said!” “This is fucked, man!” “I don’t want no more visits here, man – I use the phone from now on!” “Shee-it!”</p>
			<p>I’m going to tell my visitors to stop coming. There’s just no point to it. The phone is better.</p>
			<p>Score: Jail – l, Inmates – O.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>October 17, 1986</p>
			<p>I called the Steffans this morning at about 11:30, and talked with Dan and Greg for more than an hour. It was all the visit had not been. Greg and I compared opinions of the people we knew, discussed how we each feel about writing (he feels about fan writing not unlike the way I feel about pro writing – that once you reach the peak of your abilities, your ambition to write better works against you, making you impatient with the level of what you’re writing and making the task of writing grim work, and no fun at all), and agreed that it was a bloody shame that it wasn’t easier and cheaper to commute between the US and the U.K. “I definitely want to come back again.” I told him how much I enjoy driving cross-country and really seeing the West. “Linda wanted to do that,” Greg said. I urged him to plan for it for a future trip here. And we talked about Brighton. “I’m looking forward to the Worldcon,” I said. “This time I’ll have a much more fannish convention.” “The whole situation has changed completely since 1979,” Greg said. We agreed the current state of rapprochement between the fandoms of our countries was a marked improvement, both for us each, personally, and for fandom in general. It was an excellent conversation, and one I’m glad we were able to have, away from the pressures of the Worldcon and in a more relaxed mood.</p>

			<p>EPILOGUE: Capt. John J. Snyder, Chief of Confinement in the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Dept., sent us all the following memo:</p>
			<p>“I want to take this opportunity to apologize for the inconvenience you, your family, and friends have experienced during your recent personal visits. I feel I should advise you, so you can inform your visitors, that the problems we are now experiencing will be corrected as soon as possible. We are going to return to the telephone type communication in the visiting area. </p>
			<p>“I ask you to take into consideration the visiting communication now in use was installed and recommended by the contracted construction companies, not the Sheriff’s Department. In brief, don’t blame the deputy on duty. Be patient and understanding. We are in the process of correcting the problem.”</p>
			<p>While I’m glad changes are in the works (how long will they take? Days, weeks, or months?), I don’t accept the copout of responsibility offered by Snyder. The “construction companies” built according to detailed specifications – as all contractors for governments do – and those specifications were the responsibility of the Sheriff’s Dept. Someone fucked up.</p>
			<p>“When we were leaving,” Dan told me on the phone, “everyone was complaining to the deputies.” And somewhere along the line the number and magnitude of those complaints had an impact. Now the Sheriff’s Dept. is acting – well after the fact, and probably only because pressure has been brought to bear. It should not have been necessary.</p>
			<p>So it goes.</p>
