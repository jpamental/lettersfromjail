              <h1>Letters From Jail #19</h1>

            <h2>November 7, 1986</h2>
			<p>Changes, and more changes: John Jackson left us yesterday, to serve the rest of his time at the Manassas Jail in Prince William County. He’d been there twice recently for court appearances, spending the night in the jail there each time. “It’s a lot better, a lot better,” he said. “Hot lunches, better breakfasts, better dinners – oh, it’s a lot better,” he said. It was warm enough I could take my clothes off when I went to bed at night!”</p>
			<p>I swapped my flat mattress for his. Not a huge improvement, but I slept better.</p>
			<p>This afternoon Bernie Loeh moved in. He’d been in A-6 for several months, but got mad at another inmate who, he said, was swiping his cigarettes. The resulting tussle put them both in the Hole for ten days. Later we found out the other inmate had to be taken to the hospital first. “And you know,” he said, “while I was down there I hear this tapping on my cell door and there he is. ‘Got a cigarette, man?’ he’s saying, and he don’t even recognize me. He’s had a shower or somethin’, and he’s wandering around, cadging cigarettes!” Bernie is 40, blond, and almost movie-star handsome, in a slightly ragged way.</p>
			<p>“You been to court, been sentenced?” Mike asked him.</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s the thing,” Bernie said. “I been to court, pled guilty to burglary, but the judge, he don’t know what to do with me. He said, ‘Bring him back in a couple of months.’ He asked me what I done, I told him it’s like the story about a man, he’s pulling this big ol’ 18-foot chain down the road. A cop comes along, asks him, ‘How come you pullin’ that big o1’ chain down the road?’ And the man sez, ‘You ever tried pushin’ one?’ My lawyer, he throws all his papers up in the air. I ain’t’ seen him since.”</p>
			<p>I asked him how it happened. “Did they catch you in the act?” </p>
			<p>“I stole a vacuum cleaner – pulled it down the middle of the street, long ol’ cord trailin’ behind,” he said.</p>
			<p>Suddenly I knew who he was. I’d read a feature story in the (spitui!) Fairfax Journal a month or so ago. “That was the State Theatre,” I exclaimed, “in the middle of Falls Church!”</p>
			<p>He nodded.</p>
			<p>“I read about you,” I said, trying to remember what else the story had said. “Did you see the piece?”</p>
			<p>He had; he’d liked it. “Man came here and interviewed me after I wrote the paper a letter, asking if there was a school for auctioneers.” As I recall, the piece treated him as a colorful character, an alcoholic drifter who was basically harmless. “I’m not really a thief,” he says. He’d broken into the theater in the early hours of the morning and stolen only the vacuum cleaner, sitting in the lobby – for reasons he couldn’t explain. The newspaper story told his background, and read like a life that – forty years earlier – would easily have fit into the adventures of Jack Kerouac in On the Road. I look forward to talking with him. He is a natural story-teller, with a flair for colorful turns of phrase which I’ve not captured well here.<br /><br /></p>
