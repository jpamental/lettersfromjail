            <h2>November 9, 1986</h2>
			<p>Is not included here, for reasons of space. On November 9th I phoned Lynda Magee in Oregon and proposed marriage to her. She accepted immediately. The bulk of the letter talked about another new guy, Lewis, who was somewhat deaf, “cupping his ear to hear repeated statements or questions. Bernie, irrepressibly loquacious, talked more to him than any of us – Bernie will talk to anyone and everyone. (When a medic came to offer aspirins and laxatives, Bernie said to him, ‘Here’s a question for you. A man is shot and killed while he’s in his house, straightening a picture. The picture is of something that is behind his house. What is it?’ It turns out the man is Jesse James and the picture is of his horse.)”</p>
