              <h1>Letters From Jail #2</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 11, 1986</h2>
			<p>It’s Thursday, September 11, and there’s another football game on TV. I dozed through the 6:00 news on Channel 4, and woke after the game had begun, the noise of the TV and the men here bringing me back to life. I’ve been reading a Louis L’Amour book, and the quasi-archaic prose will probably influence what I write. </p>
			<p>I’ve had three days to get used to the routine here in A-5, and I seem to be adjusting to it. The days pass hazily, as if I’m still somewhat stoned – probably from residual fatigue.</p>
			<p>The day starts around 5:00-5:30, when the individual cell doors unlock with loud bangs, and our breakfast arrives. Breakfast is usually milk, coffee (which I don’t drink, since I want to go back to sleep again), and a tray of “food.” Today the menu was French toast (highly regarded here, but weak on egg and swimming in cheap syrup), some cake, and scrapple. On better days it will include fruit (peaches, pineapple), but there hasn’t been any the last couple of days. I can’t force myself to eat much at that hour, and give most of it away. Then, it’s back to sleep for another few hours, until lock-out. (On lock-out, I put my mattress in a cell, and sleeping is – for me – impossible.)</p>
			<p>Sometime between 8:00 and 9:30 – it varies – there is a gym call, and most of the others head off for that. I skip gym. I always hated it in school, and feel no incentive to try it here…yet. It’s quiet when the others are in gym. I can sleep, or – if gym is late and lock-out has already occurred – I can read the paper or watch TV (which is turned on – from outside – around 9:00-9:30). Charlie (also known as “Doc”) also skips gym, for medical reasons, and we may just talk quietly. He’s a black man, 40, and a recent grandfather. We have in common a love of animals, and I find him gentle and decent. He has a lot of problems, ranging from an incompetent – or worse – Public Defender to a urinary-tract problem that causes him much pain, and we talk about those.</p>
			<p>[Charlie had problems with an enlarged prostate, which made urination difficult and painful for him. Now that I’ve been taking medication for mine for the last ten years I think of him occasionally and always with compassion.]</p>
			<p>After gym, we get out the cards. Mostly we play “Dirty Hearts,” for which the penalty for losing is 15 pushups (10 for the runner-up loser). My chest muscles ache from the more than 100 pushups I’ve done in the last two days, but I am getting into better shape.</p>
			<p>Tuesday I mentioned the Jack of Diamonds Convention and they decided – without my urging it – to try it. But they dropped it Wednesday. Tuesday we also played Whist, which I prefer, but it’s been solid Hearts, Wednesday and today. I think they’re breaking me in.</p>
			<p>Lunch interrupts the game. Lunch is soup, a sandwich, and “juice.” The “juice” is weak – watered –Kool-Aid. About half the time I skip the sandwich, but always eat the soup.</p>
			<p>The game resumes, until dinner. Six of us play cards, so we rotate, with four in each game, the loser and runner-up loser sitting out. The TV is always on – Perry Mason, soap operas, Hart to Hart – but largely ignored except by Skip, who does not play cards. (I asked him why he didn’t play, and he pointed out that as an almost-trusty he was outside, working, most of each day, anyway.)</p>
			<p>Dinner is a tray of food (today: macaroni &amp; cheese, fish, peas, two pieces of bread) plus a cup of salad (coleslaw today), a cup of dessert (usually pudding, sometimes Jell-O), and “juice” or coffee. The quality varies, but there is usually a lot. During and after dinner, the 5:00 news is on Channel 4.</p>
			<p>I napped after dinner, because at 5:30 the cells unlock and I can take out my mattress. I yearn for a cell of my own – for the privacy, mostly, and a sense of a place of my own. I liked having one in DT-2, and miss it here, where – as the newest inmate – I have only a place on the floor of the dayroom. I shall have to await my turn – two others sleep out here.</p>
			<p>A few minutes ago I took a break from writing this to participate in Cleanup. We sweep out and mop down the dayroom each evening around 10-11 PM.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>The night I arrived in A-5, the first man to greet me was one of the men who also sleeps out here on the floor, a white man named Bob. He had a quality of compassion which I – new among an established group – needed. About ten years younger than I, he is a former clinical psychologist who has been for the past five years a hard-core junkie. He has a formidable intelligence, which is now reawakening – he cold-turkeyed in Receiving, a far more hellish experience than mine – and regards his time here as “R and R,” a chance to put himself back in shape. We have long talks on a wide variety of subjects, and I have come to regard him as a genuine friend – someone I’d like to know Outside. He has a daughter 18 years old, and family circumstances which parallel mine (but his is a far more distinguished family – famous, in fact).</p>
			<p>The second man to help me was Skip, who suggested I sign up for a class in problem-solving given by the psychiatrist, since attendance will both add variety to my days, and take five days a month off the time I serve. He not only suggested this, he provided a Request Form (a Request Form is required for nearly everything), and told me what to say on it. Skip looks like a young Charles Mingus, and is using his stay here to improve himself with a variety of classes, which he takes quite seriously. Skip also sleeps on the dayroom floor by choice, having passed up a chance for a cell.</p>
			<p>The others here, whom I know less well, are Red Bob – the other white man, an alcoholic – B.B., and C.W.</p>
			<p>My first night here in A-5 I decided I’d have to put in for a change of cellblock. B.B. has a radio and plays it in his cell much of the night. I couldn’t sleep through it, and it bugged me. But now I’ve adjusted to it – I slept a little Tuesday night, and better last night – and I’ve decided this is not a bad group to be in.</p>
			<p>I’ve discussed my sentence with the others, and C.W. tells me that I’ll have Mandatory Release in four months – January 5th. It could be sooner, depending on a variety of factors, like that class. I’ll be eligible for parole in 2-1/2 months—but the Parole Board meets only four times a year, and actually met this week, which means it will meet next in early December, so I couldn’t get out before then.</p>
			<p>It’s not a bad life here. The food is sometimes cruddy – and the lack of vitamins leads to canker sores in the mouth (I have a couple now) – but the only thing I truly miss, the only true addiction I have, is Pepsi/RC. Even a Coke would taste real good now.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p><br />I picked up a copy of Pat Conroy’s The Lords of Discipline down in DT-2, and brought it in with me. What an excellent book! I passed it on to Bob when I finished it yesterday. It will be hard to find anything as good here, although I’m told a library cart will come through eventually.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, I’ve made arrangements to have books sent here. We’re not allowed to have friends privately send books – or publications (no fanzines, please) – but publishers may. Last night I called the Nielsen Haydens – we are allowed unlimited collect phone calls – and had an enjoyable hour’s conversation with Teresa, Tom, and more briefly with Patrick. I told them the situation with books, and they’ve promised to have several NYC publishers send Care packages. I’ll leave them here for A-5’s private library.</p>
			<p>They gave me the phone numbers of some of my other friends, and I’ll probably call some of them…but I hate to lay a collect long-distance call on someone who isn’t expecting one. (P &amp; T had told me previously to call.) So, if you’d like to have me call you collect, drop me a letter with your phone number and the best time to call. Teresa sounded quite pleased to hear my voice – thank you, Teresa, you lightened my day considerably – but I hesitate to call, say, Rob &amp; Avedon collect, out of the blue (but I do have their number). [They lived then, as they do now, in London, England.]</p>
			<p>Teresa told me they’d received word of my sentence from Dan Steffan (who, along with rich brown and Dan Joy, attended my sentencing in court Friday), and had passed the news along to Rob and Avedon, Sue Harris (Chuck’s wife), and Phil Palmer. (In fact, both Phil Palmer and Pam Wells had called me Thursday night, while I was playing a final card game with the Steffans – thanks, people – and Rob and Avedon had called for a brief chat earlier, and I appreciated those calls.)</p>
			<p>After I told Teresa the details of my stay here, we went on to fannish gossip, which I greatly enjoyed. We talked about the Con in Atlanta, Greg [Pickersgill]’s experiences on the West Coast, and suchlike. The hour (or more) went too quickly.</p>
			<p>The ConFederation was a mixed experience for me. The Marriott Marquis is an incredible Worldcon hotel – it has a 42-story-tall atrium that looks, from almost any angle, like the actual embodiment of a 1939 Frank R. Paul cover painting, the design elegant beyond any I’ve seen before. And it was great to see Greg Pickersgill enjoying himself with a sort of belligerent bemusement at an American convention. It was also good to see Dave Bridges again, along with all the others whose company I value. (No point in dropping lots of names – I’d surely leave out too many.…) But I grew awfully tired of having to explain what I knew and what I expected to occur on and after September 5th, over and over again to so many well-wishing people. And, gratifying as it was to have someone like Jerry Pournelle asking what he could do for me, it was also a bit embarrassing.</p>
			<p>The highlight of the Con for me was the party Sunday night in Terry Carr’s room. Tom Weber, Victor, and I had decided to trip that afternoon. We started in Victor’s room at the Hyatt, listening to tapes of music he and Tom had made, and continuing with the Young Marble Giants and Eno, finishing up our time there with Eno’s classic “Here Come the Warm Jets.” It was then about 8:30, and we made the intrepid journey back to the Marriott and Terry’s party. Terry had said he didn’t want his party to run much past midnight, but when we all finally left it was 4:30 in the morning – an excellent party.</p>
			<p>It was weird being “fannish” in such a chemical state – Tom and Victor were more observers, but I found myself trying to be a participant (albeit a semi-coherent one) in the room’s conversation.</p>
			<p>Topics of that conversation included the convention’s assholes: principally Brian Earl Brown and Marty Cantor, with digressions for Eric Mayer and his wife [now his ex]. Brown had, on Wednesday night, given me Sticky Quarters #15, and even made a point of directing my attention to his asinine piece about the “Conspiracy of Silence” surrounding my bust. The poor fool was wholly undercut by the appearance – that same weekend – of the latest File:770, in which Mike quoted my letter on that topic. Cantor had been running around being his usual dorkish self, and had wound up being confronted on one panel by an angry Teresa NH (“Don’t patronize us, Marty!”).</p>
			<p>Unstated, lurking behind all this, was the Svengali of Puerto Rico, whose latest Trilby is Dave Locke, and their attack on Pickersgill’s TAFF win, which they took in such poor grace. (Locke didn’t have the guts to send me Time and Again #l when that came out, but had nerved himself to send me #2. After skimming through it, I did something I’d never done with any fanzine before: I tore it up – and sent the pieces back to him by return mail. I wonder in what way he’ll construe that.…) When we finally allowed Wiz #13 (distributed to several hundred fans with bizarre timing) to surface as a topic, Terry told us that he, from his Olympian Height, was ignoring it – despite being extensively quoted out of context in it. I tried – without success – to convince him that it was time to get off the /p/o/t/ fence and publicly refute this crap. He felt he shouldn’t “dignify” it with a response, claimed massive Behind The Scenes efforts in earlier days, and suggested we just “ignore” the individual behind it. I became heated, but no more articulate…*sigh*. I was unable to convince him that a public repudiation was not the same as a private communication to the source, nor that sticking one’s head in the sand was hardly the most effective strategy.</p>
			<p>Terry simply does not realize how little he participates in current-day fanzine fandom – and how little his restraint from comment will impact upon today’s fandom. It’s as if Dave Hartwell said “Let’s ignore the bugger” – no one really expects him to do otherwise.</p>
			<p>The party gained momentum when Gary Farber suggested we call room service for coffee, and Charlotte Proctor – in her official ConCom persona – amended that suggestion to include club sandwiches and pizza for us all. Thanks, Charlotte.</p>
			<p>This has been Not A Con Report….</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>During the writing of this it became Friday, the 12th, and midday Friday I was moved without prior notice to another cellblock – A-7. We’d had lunch, stopped playing cards (I did around 50 more pushups...), and I was working on this letter, when a guard opened the cellblock door and said “White! Get your things!”</p>
			<p>I said something like, “Huh? Um, yessir,” and collected my stuff – moth-eaten blanket, two sheets, pillow, and paper bag of personal items – and shook hands all around. Bob was showering. “I’m in the phone book – look me up Outside,” I called to him, and followed the guard out into the corridor, where I was taken two cellblocks down.</p>
			<p>I think I was moved because A-7 had just lost three inmates – one was Going Home and two spoke only Spanish and were being moved to a Spanish-speaking cellblock. There are five of us here – I’m still out on the floor of the dayroom – but I’m alone out here, which gives me more privacy. More important, it’s quieter here: the TV isn’t turned up so loud that you have to shout over it (sound rebounds from the concrete-block walls), and the men are quieter. There are three whites, including me, and two blacks, and all are easy to get along with. And, for the moment at least, there are extra mattresses – I have two, stacked. I have more control here, too – I can choose what to watch on TV, if I wish. It’s turned out to be an improvement. Of such small advantages life here is measured. (And, they play Spades here, rather than Hearts. I prefer Spades, and no pushups are involved….)</p>
			<p>The guys here showed me a sheet issued in 1981 which indicates the time one serves for one’s sentence. It’s old, and I’ve put in a request for an up-to-date one, but, if this sheet still applies, I have even less time to serve than I’d expected: about two months! I could be out of here before Halloween, and certainly before Thanksgiving! Wow!</p>
			<p>Suddenly it’s starting to look like a piece of cake…relatively speaking. It’s certainly not nearly as bad as I’d expected – in either the experience itself, or the amount of time involved. At the moment I’m happier about being here than I’ve previously been. That may change, of course – “You’ll find there are good days and bad days,” Bob told me the other day – but I’m optimistic now,</p>
			<p>And that’s probably a good place to end this Letter. In future Letters I’ll describe various aspects of life here which I haven’t yet gone into, and continue the general chronicle of existence.</p>
