            <h2>October 22, 1986</h2>
			<p><br />Today at “Forensics Class” Dan wasn’t his usual talkative self. I asked him what was wrong. </p>
			<p>“Oh, man, this place is really getting me down. It’s really getting to me! I’m in a cellblock full of assholes with nothing to do all day but just sit there and try to ignore them. I ought to be getting out in a week or two, but there’s this fucking investigator from Alexandria trying to pin a bad-check charge on me – even though I was in here when it’s supposed to have happened – and I know he’s gonna fuck up my release, the asshole!”</p>
			<p>I’ve never seen him like this before. He’s really depressed. I’d brought him a book he wanted to read – The Choirboys – and was looking forward to seeing him. “I don’t like anybody in my cellblock,” he said. “There’s no respect, no friendship – just assholes wising off all the time.”</p>
			<p>“I think Classification is fucking up,” Red Bob said. “We’re getting all these kids in A-5. They yell all the time, and they watch fuckin’ cartoons all day on the TV. Always switching channels, always making noise. It’s getting on my nerves.” He’s 42. “We’ve done written out three of them – three at once, that’s some kind of a record for us!”</p>
			<p>“Too bad we’re full up,” I told Dan. “Or I’d suggest you come down to A-7. We got a friendly cellblock.”</p>
			<p>“I gotta do something, man,” Dan said. “This place is doing bad things to my head.”</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>BITS: If you’re here without funds, you get certain items from Commissary without paying for them. Phil gets a tube – very small – of toothpaste every week. “I don’t use a tube every week,” he told me. “I got three of them now. If you need toothpaste, I’ll give you one.”</p>
			<p>I’d bought a small tube when I made my first Commissary order. It turned out to be Crest with fluoride, which satisfied me. I normally use a fluoride toothpaste. So when it ran out, I asked Phil for a tube. But what he gave me was not Crest with fluoride, but Colgate without fluoride, and the tube was even smaller. Most odd was the sticker pasted on the box and on the (metal) tube: “MADE IN BRAZIL” it said. The writing on both box and tube was, naturally, bilingual – English and Portuguese. Why is the jail giving away Brazilian-made toothpaste?</p>
			<p>Immediately after I was sentenced, when a Deputy took me from the courtroom, he told me, “I’ve been in all the jails in Virginia, and this is the best. You should be glad this is where you’ll be doing your time.” He also told me I’d be doing nine months of my one-year sentence. Both statements were false – and probably knowing lies. The Fairfax County Jail – excuse me: Adult Detention Center – is the worst in at least Northern Virginia. It is worse than the Alexandria City Jail, the Arlington County Jail, the Prince William County Jail, and the Leesburg City Jail, that I know of. I base this on the statements of those who have been to these other jails. In those jails one is not locked out of one’s individual cell during the day, and the food is better. Jackson, for instance, was taken to Prince William County for a court appearance which required him to be housed in the jail there for two days, and told us what it was like: “They put me in a regular cell – not on the dayroom floor – and the food was a lot better. We got a full meal for lunch.” Here one gets a sandwich and a bowl of soup, or just two sandwiches.</p>
			<p>General opinion is that the guards are a lot more decent in those other jails, too. Here, some treat you like a human being, but the majority like to pull petty sadistic tricks, some of which I’ve described already. (The other day one looked in during the evening, making a routine head-count. I was in my cell writing a letter. “Where’s White?” I looked up and said “Yo!” and waved at him through the window of my cell door. He jerked the door open and said, in what I assume he thought was a joking voice, “Boy, don’t you ever go up before a jury, ’cause you look guilty. Haw, haw, I never seen anybody look more guilty. Haw, haw. You sure look guilty, awright. You better not let a jury get a look at you! Haw, haw, haw.” Then he left. “What was that all about?” I asked the others in the dayroom. “He’s just jerking your chain,” Jack said.)</p>
			<p>We talked about that in our Group today. A new member of the group, the only black in it, recently said, “They racist here, man.” He named names and examples – too many for me to recall them all – but one stuck with me. He’d filed a Request Form with a guard for the use of a free phone to call the hospital where his father was dying of cancer (such places don’t accept collect calls), and had gotten no response. While he was in the company of the chief psychologist he asked her if she could help him. She called the guard over and asked him about it. The guard said no Request Form had been filed. Since the inmate knew he’d filed one, he accused the guard of throwing it away. The psychologist wavered between believing him or the guard so he suggested they look in the trash basket. She agreed, over the guard’s protest. The trash was searched and “There it was, all wadded up, with chewing tobacco stains all over it, man!” His point had been proved, but he never did get his call. He was told he could write a letter instead.</p>
			<p>After several exchanges of correspondence with the circulation department, I’m finally receiving the Washington Post here. Today I received Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday’s copies with my mail. (Apparently, they’ll come one day late through the mail, at a premium. Thank ghod I paid a year in advance last spring, because my remaining six weeks here may exhaust that subscription.) What a relief to have a real newspaper to read! I’ll pass them on to the rest of the guys when I finish them, and then put them on the bench outside our door at cleanup, so others can enjoy them. I’m a news-junkie, and this really helps pass the time in here.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>October 23, 1986</p>
			<p>&#9;</p>
			<p>Well, maybe. Today no Post came in the mail. If Wednesday’s paper doesn’t arrive in tomorrow’s mail (along with today’s) I’ll file a grievance form. It’s more than pilferage – it’s tampering with federal mail. The vengeful in me would love to pin that on a guard here.</p>
			<p>They have a new trick they’ve been pulling this week: delaying opening our cells for several hours.&#9;</p>
			<p>Normally Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays are Shaving Days. On these days numbered razors are passed out, used, and returned. Each man who takes a razor has its number noted by his name. Normally the razors are passed out in late morning or early afternoon. </p>
			<p>But this week they’ve been passed out after dinner. Normally, when a guard opens the cellblock door to remove the dinner trays and cups (using his foot or his pushbroom), he “pops the doors” of the cells immediately afterward, and we’re free to enter our cells. I look forward to this. I like to lie down after dinner, to read, nap, or write letters (or Letters) at my tiny “desk,” rather than on my lap.<br /><br />Tuesday dinner was very late — it didn’t arrive until 6 PM — an hour late, and seven hours after lunch. (It was fried chicken, so we forgave the wait. Fried – or barbecued – chicken is the best dinner one gets here, usually about once every two weeks or so.) After dinner, the guard, as he kicked our empty trays out into the hall, asked, “Anyone want to shave in here?”<br /><br />The usual group did. (Mike and I have beards, and Jack, half Cherokee, shaves only once a week.)<br /><br /> “I’ll be back to pass out razors,” the guard said, and disappeared without opening our cells.<br /><br />Half an hour later, he was back with the razors.<br /><br />“How about unlocking the cells?” Bill brightly inquired.<br /><br />The guard gave him a contemptuous look. “After you’ve shaved,” he said, as though addressing someone who was mentally retarded.<br /> <br />Bill doesn’t have a cell, but has complained that the steel mirror over the dayroom sink is hard to use, since the light over it is far too high. He looked in my cell one evening and noticed that the light in my cell was much lower, just over the mirror, and made the mirror much more useful. Perhaps he’d thought to shave in one of our cells – I wouldn’t have minded him using mine – or perhaps he was just being his usual helpful (sometimes too helpful) self.</p>
			<p>So everyone shaved – using already well-used disposable razors – and then we waited, and waited and waited. Finally, the guard returned to collect them. “Can you open the cells now?” Bill asked him.</p>
			<p>“When I’m done collecting the razors,” the guard replied. He finally returned to unlock the cells with a, ratta-tatoo of extra bangs at 8:30. Normally they’re unlocked around 5:30.<br /><br />Last night dinner was late again, but without the excuse of passing out razors, our cells were unlocked at around 6:30.<br /><br />Tonight – again – dinner was a half-hour late, and – again – they waited until after dinner to pass out razors. </p>
			<p>“Those assholes,” I grumbled.<br /><br />”No sense letting it get to you, man,” Mike said. “Don’t matter none. They just playing with your head.”<br /><br />It was 7 PM before our cells were unlocked. I skimmed a Reader’s Disgust (or Digest) while Mike played quick hands of solitaire, one after another. I noticed once the cells were unlocked, he disappeared into his.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Have I mentioned that the only eating utensil we get with our food is a plastic spoon – which we are required to return with our trays? Most of the food we get is soft enough to be cut with a plastic spoon – even the cooked meat – which is just as well, I think. A high percentage of the inmates are lacking a significant number of their teeth. (It was a bad joke when they gave Wayne Treon – still here as a Trusty – apples each evening as part of his diet as a diabetic after they pulled his last four teeth.)</p>
			<p>#<br /></p>
			<p>Well, this evening they finally figured out that they’d given Phil a sweater that didn’t belong to him.<br /></p>
			<p>They’d brought it to him a day or two after I moved into A-7, back in the middle of September. “What’s this?” Phil asked.</p>
			<p>“It’s your sweater,” the guard said. “Somebody sent it in to you.”<br /></p>
			<p>“It ain’t mine,” Phil said. He looked at the collar. “Look,” he said, “it says ‘G.H.’ on the collar. “That’s not me.”<br /><br />“Your name ‘Funk’?” the guard asked.<br /></p>
			<p>“Yes, but….”</p>
			<p>“It’s yours,” the guard said. He left.</p>
			<p>&#9;</p>
			<p>Phil filled out a request form stating that it wasn’t his and had been misdelivered to him. Another guard came in and looked at it. “I’m not ‘G.H.’,” Phil said. “Well, maybe ‘G.H.’ sent it to you,” the guard said. “I don’t know any ‘G.H.’,” Phil said. “Keep it,” the guard said, and left.</p>
			<p>&#9;</p>
			<p>It got cold in here. One day I asked if I could wear it, since he refused to wear it. He said sure. I wore it for most of a month.<br /><br />A couple of months ago Michael Nally, during one of his weekly Saturday visits, asked if he could get me anything. “Yes,” I said, “a set of thermal underwear.” I’d noticed a lot of the guys – including Phil – wearing thermals to stay warm. Last week Michael brought me a set. “I brought two,” he said, “’but they’d only let me send one in to you.” I suggested that he try the second set the following week.<br /></p>
			<p>About five hours after Michael’s visit, a guard brought me the set of thermal underwear in a paper bag. I doffed the sweater and donned the thermal top. The next day I put the sweater (a sweatshirt, really) through the “personal laundry.” It’s been in my clean laundry bag since then.</p>
			<p>Tonight a guard came by and demanded the sweater. “It’s not yours,” he told Phil sternly.</p>
			<p>“I told you that when you gave it to me,” Phil retorted.</p>
			<p>“Well, let’s have it,” the guard said. “Where is it?”<br /></p>
			<p>Phil looked at me. I nodded. “It’s in ‘C’ cell,” he said. It was after dinner, the razors hadn’t come yet, and the cells were all locked.<br /></p>
			<p>The guard unlocked my cell and watched while I went in and retrieved the sweater. “Close that door,” he said as I came out with the sweater in my hand.<br /></p>
			<p>“Why?” I said. “It’s after dinner.” </p>
			<p>“Close it,” he said threateningly.</p>
			<p>I closed it, and he left with the sweater.</p>
			<p>“He’s not the one who’s responsible for unlocking these cells,” Mike observed.<br /></p>
			<p>“I knew they’d figure it out eventually,” Phil said, “’There’s two other Funks upstairs in the B-cells. Gotta be one of theirs.”&#9;</p>
			<p>&#9;<br />I was just as glad I’d had the use of it until I had thermals to wear.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>At mail call today a wimpy looking guard (one of those regarded by the guys in here as a “Georgetown fagot” with his regulation Gay Mustache) called “White!”<br /></p>
			<p>I got up from the chair where I’d been sitting, reading, “Yes, sir,” I said.</p>
			<p>“You White?” he asked through the door.</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir,” I said. “I’m White.”</p>
			<p>“I can see you’re white,” he said, “but what’s your name?”</p>
			<p>“My name’s White,” I said. </p>
			<p>He peered at me. “Okay,” he said, and began opening my mail….</p>
