            <h2>October 9, 1986</h2>
			<p>I was watching Love Connection in a desultory way yesterday morning when a guard came to the door. “White!” he shouted through the door. “You going to your forensics class today?”</p>
			<p>“Sure,” I said, wondering why he was asking.</p>
			<p>“Okay,” he said. “I’ll be back for you in ten minutes.”</p>
			<p>My “forensics class” is not a class, and not about “forensics” either, as I understand the word. It’s basically a group of inmates who get together at 9:45 AM Wednesday for an hour of discussion moderated by a clinical psychologist named Chris Tull – “group therapy” in a loose sense. There are no tests and no grades.</p>
			<p>It’s a decent group. Regulars include Dan, from A-10, who is a musician and a serious composer (and is in here on charges similar to mine), Red Bob from A-5, and two other guys from the B-floor whose names I’m not sure of. One is a young bearded guy who has had problems with being bullied by his cellmates (he’s moved cellblocks six times, and seems to have found a safe haven at last), and the other is quiet but endeared himself to me by stating that my entrance into the group had “livened things up.” The intelligence level is higher than that of the general population here, which makes for good discussions.</p>
			<p>This week I unloaded my annoyance with Chester – with an abbreviated version of my last Letter – and Dan said, “I know where you’re coming from, man. I have so little in common with my cellmates, there’s just whole areas you can’t talk about with them.” This led into a discussion of the macho poses so many of the younger inmates adopt.&#9;</p>
			<p>“One of the guys in our cellblock,” Red Bob said – and then in an aside to me, “C.W.” – “he would come up to gym and act like he was the baddest of the bad, but back in our cellblock, he’d cry and just go to pieces. He just couldn’t deal with being in here.” That had happened before I was in A-5.</p>
			<p>“A lot of these guys, they’re really into stealing,” the quiet guy said. “They come up here to a class, and they have to steal something, doesn’t matter what it is, or whether they got any use for it. It’s like a habit with them, stealing.” Then he launched into a sudden impassioned diatribe:</p>
			<p>“There’s a guy in my cellblock, we just wrote him out today – he oughta be gone by this afternoon. He really turns my stomach. One of our guys was in court with him yesterday afternoon, and found out what he’s here for.</p>
			<p>“This guy pushed his way into a woman’s apartment while she was carrying in a bag of groceries, and he, like, beat her, cut her up, and raped her. He caved in the whole side of her face with a lamp, then beat on her till she looked like hamburger. Then he starts cutting on her. And all the while he’s raping her! He’s got her tied up with an electrical cord the whole while. She’s in the hospital for two months now, and they just caught the guy. And – get this – when they catch him, two months after he’s done it, he’s got her underwear around his neck, like a necklace, under his clothes! I mean, this is one sick animal!</p>
			<p>“We knew he was sick. He’d talk all the time about beating up women – he was down on everything, you know? But he wouldn’t talk about what he was here for until we confronted him with it last night. Then he admitted it – and he was proud of it! Man, that just turned my stomach!”</p>
			<p>“What’s he doing in a B-cell?” the kid asked. “He-ought to be in C.” (C is for murderers and rapists.)</p>
			<p>Dan shook his head knowingly. “He’s not sentenced yet.”</p>
			<p>The “presumption of innocence” in its most perverse form.</p>
			<p>“Man like that,” the quiet guy said, “they ought to just take him out and shoot him – like a rabid dog!”</p>
			<p>“This really upsets you, doesn’t it?” Dan asked.</p>
			<p>“Yeah, it really does.”</p>
			<p>“Why’s that?”</p>
			<p>“Shit, he just really turns my stomach!”</p>
			<p>It’s said that child molesters rarely last long in the general population. Someone sticks something sharp into them. Even a pencil can do it. The rapist was getting off easy by being written out.</p>
			<p>Chris Tull is soft-looking – a little pudgy, wearing glasses and a mustache, prematurely balding – and a “Cognitive Psychologist.” He often says little, but asks perceptive questions – when they’re not too pointed. I asked him whether I’d really get any time off for attending his “class” – after 30 days one puts in for a slip and he awards up to five days – since supposedly this is awarded by the sheriff, and State prisoners can’t receive “favors” from a local authority. He said he wasn’t sure himself, having recently come from the Maryland system, which is entirely different, but it wouldn’t hurt to put in for it. I’ll be eligible to put in for the reduction next week – 30 days after September 18th, when I attended my first class. Chris is friendly, and says he reads science fiction – but not the SF magazines.</p>
			<p>Wednesday is also laundry day, so when I came back downstairs from the classroom, a little before 11 AM, I was not surprised to hear from the hall deputy that shirts and pants had already been exchanged in my absence. This happens about every other week. The deputy took my requirements – “large” shirt and “36” pants – and came back with the laundry Trusty an hour later. I pulled off my pants and took off my shirt and passed them both through the slot in the door. A shirt and a pair of pants, both rolled up, were passed back to me. The shirt was too small to button, the pants impossible to close. The pants said “32” quite plainly on the inside waistband. I passed both back out with a shrug of disgust, and properly sized clothes were passed in.</p>
			<p>At lock-out, earlier that morning, a mesh bag was left for our “personal laundry.” We loaded it with our underwear. It came back shortly before noon, its drawstring tightly knotted. Our underwear, like most of the laundry, comes back smelling of Clorox. I suppose that’s necessary, considering what some cons have living on their bodies. The “personal laundry” goes through the wash in the mesh bags, keeping it sorted by cellblock.</p>
			<p>In the evening, after our cells are unlocked, our sheets, towels, and pillowcases are collected. These are counted as we pass them out the door slot, and we get back the same number.&#9;</p>
			<p>Wednesday night is my night to chat on the phone with the Nielsen Haydens and Tom Weber. I was vastly relieved to hear that my collect calls were not being charged at $1.09 a minute, as a representative of AT&amp;T had told them, but at a much lower rate, as their phone bill for September had revealed. I was so relieved that I talked with Patrick, Teresa, and Tom for at least two hours. Indeed, I was surprised that the phone – which is usually cut off shortly after 11 PM – was still functioning at 11:45.</p>
			<p>As we talked, clean-up took place around me (I’ve done it often enough that I feel no guilt when I don’t – it only takes three people, anyway), and the sheets, etc., were returned. I snagged two sheets – making sure neither were the thin, cheesecloth variety – but missed my towel and pillowcase. When I finally got off the phone, I asked around for the extra towel and pillowcase. “Uh, didn’t you get yours, Ted?” Bill innocently asked. </p>
			<p>“No,” I said, “just my sheets.”</p>
			<p>“Oh,” he said, slipping them out from under his sheets, where he’d hidden them. “I thought these were extras.”</p>
			<p>I’ve learned a few tricks about making up one’s jail-cell bed here. I noticed in A-5 that Skip – also on the floor – knotted the ends of his sheets, tying the corners of each end together. This creates a “fitted sheet” that fits over the ends of the mattress pads. This appears to be a common practice here, and works quite well. My cell’s mattress, formerly Wayne Treon’s, is larger than the one I had on the floor – longer and wider by about four inches in each dimension. It’s also very thin in its center, most of the padding having migrated to the edges. At first I thought I couldn’t “fit” my bottom sheet to it, but I learned that I could scrunch the corners of the mattress in enough to make it work. I also took my old mattress from the floor into my cell, slipping it under the larger mattress and creating a little more padding between me and the concrete shelf. So far no one has objected to this, although one guard did notice.</p>
			<p>It’s not truly comfortable in my cell-bed, but relatively speaking it’s a lot more comfortable than the floor. I can’t lie in one position too long, though, before it puts the part of my body I’m lying on to sleep – in the pins-and-needles sense. There’s no “give” in the padding, you see. Yet, being sufficiently adaptable, my body has learned to get a decent night’s sleep under these conditions. I now sleep better than I ever did out on the floor. (My “extra-firm” bed at home will probably feel obscenely soft when I return to it.)</p>
			<p>Most of my dreams are pleasantly escapist – in one Dan Steffan showed me a fascinating dummy for a digest-sized SF magazine which intrigued me for several days thereafter with its freshness and novelty (Dan is now art director for a slick D.C. monthly, and has the enviable task of totally redesigning it, which undoubtedly was the root of my dream) – but every so often I have dreams about being home, but only temporarily, and having to come back here. These are sad dreams, a sign of Reality breaking through my Fantasy, my awareness of being stuck here.</p>
			<p>“Some people just can’t handle being in here,” Red Bob said yesterday. “Me, I figure I did it, they got me, and I’m here to do my time. I don’t worry about it – I just accept it.” </p>
			<p>I try to do the same. Usually it’s not that hard. I don’t tease myself by staring out the window for hours.</p>
			<p>I accept the confines of the cellblock as my present “home,” and welcome the opportunity to retreat into my cell in the evenings.</p>
			<p>“You doing it right,” Lonny told me recently. Lonny has a twinkle in his eyes. “You got a handle on it okay.”</p>
			<p>I’ll miss Lonny when he leaves this Saturday. Like Wayne and Jackson, he is a force for stability and calm, unfailingly good-humored and easygoing. These last few days have been the hardest for him, waiting for them to crawl by and his release to occur. We talk about it. We talk about where he’ll go – “I want to go somewhere warm, man. California appeals to me.” He’s never been to California. It’s hard for him to sit still now. He mock-boxes with the shower curtain. He paces like a caged animal. It’s getting close now. He can almost taste it. Only one more full day in here. He’ll leave Saturday morning.</p>
			<p>Phil mentioned a guy who was here before I was. They’d told him his release date a week or two earlier, and on that date a guard came and called him. “There’s been a change in your release date,” the guard told him. “They’ve given you two more months.”</p>
			<p>“His face went white,” Phil said. “Then the guard told him it was just a joke” – Phil snorted – “and to get his things.”</p>
			<p>“Some joke,” Lonny said. “Thass some joke all right.” He shook his head with disgust.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>AFTERMATH: We’d been watching NBC – Cheers, Nightcourt, Hill St. Blues – and then started playing a game of Hearts. It was 11:30 or a little later when the fire alarm went off – again. It had gone off for an extended time – fifteen minutes or more – last night, between 8 and 9 PM, and fire trucks had pulled up outside, but a guard told me it was “Just a drill.” Tonight was no drill. Not only were there lots of trucks outside, the air-conditioning system carried the distinct odor of smoke into our block.</p>
			<p>Lonny had locked himself into his cell early tonight. When I went into mine (after winning the game) the smell of smoke was much stronger. I hope Lonny didn’t have bad dreams.</p>
