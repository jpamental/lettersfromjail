              <h1>Letters From Jail #4</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 18, 1986</h2>
			<p>For several days life in A-7 was close to ideal – for jail, anyway. Then, in one day, two new inmates were assigned to our cellblock. Mike, an aging biker with a broken collarbone, came in Sunday afternoon. He’d suffered his injury running from the police – he’d jumped a guardrail and fallen over a 30-foot drop. The “doctor” here wanted to put an Ace bandage on him – an incompetent treatment. Instead, he insisted on a sling for his left arm, to ease the pressure on the break. But he’s received no other treatment; and his left shoulder has been an inflamed angry red. (The medical treatment here – or lack thereof – is truly criminal.) Mike claims extensive brain damage from the excessive use of many drugs, but reveals in conversation and card playing a sharp mind. I can get along with him – he responds readily to friendly acts.</p>
			<p>But Steve is another story. He was put in here Sunday night, after lock-in, and was relatively quiet the first day, but has developed, over the following week, into a pushy, insensitive asshole. He commandeers the TV, tries to change the rules of the card games, and shoots his mouth off with profound ignorance, insulting us all with his bullshit. He told us Monday that he’d be out that evening – “All I gotta do is make bond, man, and I got the money” – but he’s still here at the end of the week. Yesterday, he was going to be out “in two hours, man – I got my man downstairs right now,” but that too was a false alarm. Each day he gets harder to take, and we’ve decided that if he’s still here by next Monday we’ll “write him out” by requesting he be reassigned to another cellblock.</p>
			<p>The five of us who were here before get along well, and like each other. The other four can retreat to their individual cells after dinner (5:00-5:30) and escape, but I’m stuck out here on the floor. I miss the quiet of the first few days here in A-7 – and so do they.</p>
			<p>This Thursday I attended my first meeting of the Psychologist’s Group. This was represented to me as “a class in problem-solving,” which it is, but it’s really a group-therapy group. The hour passed quickly and rewardingly. The psychologist is a decent guy, and several of the guys (there are six of us) are obviously intelligent. B.B. and Red Bob from A-5 are in the group, and it was good to see them again.</p>
			<p>I’ve received regular mail – averaging a letter a day – and books have arrived in considerable quantity. The rule is that one can receive books and magazines only from their publishers. I relayed this through the Nielsen Haydens, and Gary Farber sent 59 (!) books from Avon. They arrived in a big box and a Jiffy bag. The deputy in the property department looked up the regulation and determined that I could have only five at a time. I’d have to check in the first five when I was ready for the second five, and so on.</p>
			<p>But today ten hardcover books sent by Moshe Feder from Doubleday arrived (in two batches), and the deputy on duty this time let me take all of them back to the cellblock. Thanks to both of you – I think I’ve already got enough to read, and I’m told there’s still more on the way….</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p><br />Have I described what these cellblocks are like? The sketch [see diagram] gives you a rough idea. The room is all concrete blocks, with a half-wall separating the combination toilet/sink from the rest of the dayroom. (Individual cells have their own toilet/sinks as well.) The table and its surrounding bench are steel, bolted to the wall and floor. The doors – to both the cells and the hallway – can be locked and unlocked by either keys or an electric control in the hall. The cellblocks are intended for four inmates each, but typically have as many as seven and in some cases ten occupants. Because there are no sound-deadening materials, it can get noisy easily. The TV becomes shrill, its sound bouncing from wall to wall, and we must raise our voices to be heard. Telephone conversation is then difficult. This has become much worse since Steve arrived. My mattress goes along the wall opposite the cell doors, my head near the phone. My mattress is a narrow gray-vinyl-covered pad, maybe two inches thick. My pillow is a pillow-shaped pad, of similar construction. I have two sheets, a pillowcase, and a thin gray blanket. When it’s cold – which it has been (the air-conditioning is too strong) – I sleep with all my clothes on.</p>
			<p>Tonight Phil Funk and I ended up in Wayne Treon’s cell, swapping stories until 1 AM (lock-in was late), just to get away from Asshole Steve, who watched TV by himself (the others had crashed already). It was cozy and pleasant in Wayne’s cell. We talked about cars, car accidents, truck (tractor-trailer) driving, and, eventually, Vietnam. Phil was a gunner there, and, in his words, “It like to fucked up my nerves real bad.” He told us some truly amazing stories – and made very real for me the incredible experience he’d undergone. “After ’Nam,” he said, “this place is a piece of cake.” I believe him.</p>
			<p>These are guys I find easy to like. What I find less easy to like is the constant coarseness of attitude this jail (and all prisons) breeds in men. TV is watched mainly to comment on the “pussy” being viewed. Yesterday a half-dozen female inmates had their hair cut in the barbershop directly across the hall from our door. None was really attractive, but we piled up against our door to watch them…myself included. The lack of normal social interaction with women makes even something like this a strange treat. We smiled, winked, made lewd comments, and were inordinately pleased when one of the women smiled or winked back. “Look – she’s licking her lips!” “Oh, man, would I like some of that!”</p>
			<p>A popular TV show in here is The New Dating Game – the “bachelorettes” are dissected and rated by their anatomical attributes. Jerks like Steve ignore their personalities, although others may comment, “What an airhead!” (Steve will say, “Thass all right – I take her anyway.”) One joins in, in order not to seem different – I wonder if we’re all trying to live up to some commonly perceived peer attitude. (But, when the 5:00 news tonight reported a rape in which a woman’s screams were heard but ignored, several men, Steve in the main, opined that, “Thass how you gotta treat them bitches.” The black men in here seem to genuinely hate women – perhaps a result of growing up in female-dominated families; I don’t know.)</p>
			<p>What I fear in myself is the ease with which I can adapt to prison life. My accent has appreciably thickened. Among whites I talk “country” and among blacks I talk black…there are only subtle differences between the two. I have never before sounded so “Southern.” Attitudes are closely linked with patterns of speech. I feel myself coarsening. Thank ghod for the occasional visits, and the phone calls, in which I can return to former contexts.</p>
			<p>I’ve been here for two weeks now. I have roughly eight to go. That seems – right now – easy enough. But what I fear is change: new people with whom to deal.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>I was really shaken up when they moved me from A-5 to A-7 – even though I soon realized this was a better group. When the group here was expanded, I resented the change. (That’s separate from resenting Steve.) Bob, in A-5, told me, “The dynamics really changed when you moved in here, Ted.” And they keep on changing.</p>
			<p>Next Monday – the 22nd – more change may occur. A new wing is to be opened in the jail. How this will affect us, we don’t know. Will I be moved again? Will others here be moved? I crave stability, with companionable cellmates. But, as one guard pointed out to us when someone complained about something, “This is a jail, man!” I guess it’s all part of the punishment.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Life for my daughter has had its ups and downs. Matthew Moore – my business partner in the small record company we own, and a fellow member of Barbara &amp; the Bohemians – was to move into my house, but had a dispute with Kit, and did not. Instead, she lived alone, with frequent visits from my mother. It seemed viable for 21/2 months, and she said she was enjoying it. At sixteen, she has learned to be responsible for herself, after all. But it reached her school counselor that she was living alone, and that person threatened to have her placed in a foster home, so now she’s staying with a family in Falls Church which had offered her a place to stay if she needed it. I have come to resent more and more the officiousness of social workers and school authorities who treat nearly adult teenagers as irresponsible children, and who follow inflexible rules.</p>
			<p>Then Kit’s mother, my ex-wife Robin, wrote my mother an incredibly condescending letter in which she said I was, in effect, a bad father, a bad influence on Kit, and liable to expose her to sexual abuse from my irresponsible friends, and she requested custody of “her daughter,” for whom she had always cared so much…blah, blah, blah….</p>
			<p>My mother wrote her a cool reply, and let Kit have her mother’s letter. The letter pissed Kit off and, when she read it to me on the phone, pissed me off too. To properly appreciate why, you have to know that Robin abandoned Kit to me when Kit was only three, and has rarely been of any help in raising her since then (she presently lives in Arizona).</p>
			<p>“I love her, because she’s my mother,” Kit says, “but I don’t like her.” Robin has, over the past fifteen years, lost most of those qualities I once valued in her and loved her for, and has become the quintessential bitch – self-obsessed, ego-driven, and arrogantly condescending. I sometimes wonder if this was inevitable – in which case, I’m glad we split up, much as it hurt at the time – or if it’s the product of her experiences since leaving me. Surely the fact that she walked out on us is an indication of the tendencies that have developed in her since then, but I was stunned by the attitudes implicitly expressed in her letter. Needless to say, she’ll not gain custody of Kit now – nor does Kit want her to.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>I read two Helen MacInnes books which were in the jail library: The Snare of the Hunter and While We Still Live. I hadn’t read her before, but I found myself enjoying both books quite a bit, and I’ll have to try some of her others. The sense of place – Europe – in both books was good, and While We Still Live (first published in 1944) has a shattering insider’s description of the Nazi invasion of Poland. It’s interesting to contrast the situations described in that book with life here in jail – and it makes life here seem pleasant in contrast.</p>
			<p>I haven’t had much purely fannish news since coming here – and there hasn’t been much time for any, I guess. So I continue to think back to Atlanta, and the Worldcon. The fannish sub-convention seemed smaller than usual, for reasons I haven’t fully pinned down.</p>
			<p>The fan-lounge was nowhere nearly as successful as a place to hang out and meet people as was the fan-lounge at LACon, despite the friendly proprietary presence of Linda Blanchard and Dave Bridges. The cash bar seemed grossly underused (the hotel staff members running it looked bored by the lack of business), and all too often most of the people hanging out there were costumed types or media fen poring over Doctor Who fanzines. I asked several people why they weren’t in the fan-lounge more and was told that in their cases it was because it was a no-smoking area. (The explanation for this was that it adjoined the fanzine sales room, where Marty Cantor – contrary to previous announcement – had set up shop, and Marty had of course declared that room a smoking area. I have never smelled such a foul-smelling pipe-tobacco as that which Cantor uses. I hear it’s his own special blend. That figures….)</p>
			<p>In any case, the con seemed to lack much focus – there was really no central meeting spot, lounges being scattered everywhere in the two hotels. There wasn’t even just one bar in which to congregate – each hotel had several. “The Hub” in the Marriott had a free-food bar open in the evenings, which Frank Lunney and Catherine Jackson discovered Thursday. Sandy Cohen and I tried it one night, and enjoyed it, but never made it back again.</p>
			<p>Monday evening several of us tried the Marriott’s seafood restaurant, which turned out to be quite good. Victor Gonzalez treated me to an excellent meal which climaxed with Blackened Swordfish – thanks again, Victor.</p>
			<p>Several nights we ended up at the Bridge Publications parties on the 40th floor of the Marriott. I felt strange taking advantage of the hospitality of Scientologists (whom I despise as lying fascists), so I did not avail myself of either the food or drinks they offered – but it was a good suite for party conversation. Terry’s room, Sunday night, was much better, however.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Today (Saturday, the 19th) I received a copy of the Nielsen Haydens’ letter, along with my Jail Letter #1, and I see there are some points I should clear up.</p>
			<p>Sentence time: Basically, one serves one-sixth of the State Time one receives (more, if it’s County Time). I have seen several computations now, and, with “Good Time” (time off for good behavior) figured in, it appears my one-year sentence translates into about ten weeks, or two months and thirteen days. In addition, I can shave off another five days every four weeks I attend a class – any class – but two classes will not make it ten days, so there’s no advantage in taking more than one class. My class in Problem Solving will thus take off at least five days, and, if I have time to complete the second four weeks, ten days. So I have, as of now, about eight weeks to go. I can live with that.</p>
			<p>Visitation: I am allowed six visitors, each of whom can visit only once a week. I filled out a card, listing six visitors – my mother, my daughter, Michael Nally, his wife Edie, Matthew Moore, and Dan Steffan. When I did that I thought I’d be moved downstate, and Edie had promised Kit she’d bring her for a visit. As it turns out I’ll stay here, and Edie, who has two small children, won’t need to bring Kit and would have a hard time getting here herself. Michael, who visits me Saturdays, says it’s okay to take Edie off the list, so I can add Lynn Steffan. There’s no real point in anyone else bothering.</p>
			<p>Size: I think Teresa misunderstood me. The jail is not particularly small. There are over 300 inmates here. We are situated on at least four floors. GH-1and 2, the many Receiving cells, and DT-1and 2 are all on the lowest level. I am now one floor up on the A-level. I’m not sure how many cellblocks there are here on A, but I know of at least thirteen. Above us are the B and C levels. The B-level cellblocks are slightly larger, having five individual cells each of which houses two inmates. B-cells lack individual toilets. The B-level is for younger inmates. The C-level I know least about, except that it’s for the true badasses, and to be avoided.</p>
			<p>In addition to cellblocks, each level has other areas as well. Visiting, Property, the barbershop, and the psychologist’s office are all on A-level. The classrooms and library and gym are on the B-level. I’ve never been up to C-level.</p>
			<p>Teresa’s confusion arose from thinking that one cellblock is all the jail has. As should be obvious from the foregoing, there are many cellblocks here, each of which has a dayroom and four or five individual cells. One stays in one’s own cellblock except when seeing a visitor, receiving property, attending a class, or going to the gym. I hope this clarifies things.</p>
