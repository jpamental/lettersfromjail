              <h1>Letters From Jail #6</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 25, 1986</h2>
			<p>“You have your good days, and you have your bad days,” Bob said to me in A-5. As time goes on, that becomes more and more obviously true. Yesterday was a Bad Day; today has been mixed, but somewhat better.</p>
			<p>Yesterday, when I went to my psychology group, I learned that it was unrealistic to believe that I’d be getting out as soon as mid-November. It would be more realistic to expect to leave on my Mandatory Parole date – early January. Had I not begun thinking my sentence already almost one-third served, that would not have hit so hard. “Expect to leave when they tell you you’re leaving,” Mike counseled me, from his own experience.</p>
			<p>Then, as pre-arranged, I called the Nielsen Haydens that night and learned that my collect calls were being billed at $1.09 a minute, and that thus far I’d added over $200 to their phone bill. That was a shock. I’d come to especially value those calls, and the long chats with Tom Weber, Patrick, and Teresa – a chance to escape the context of this jail and roam once again the corridors of fandom. Teresa and I had enjoyed a particularly good conversation on my previous call. But, despite their desire that I continue to call once a week, how could I burden them with huge phone bills on an ongoing basis?</p>
			<p>INSERT AUNT JULIA NOCAP RRTEXT</p>
			<p>That night – last night – I had my first Jail Dreams. I have always enjoyed – and usually remembered, at least in tone and overall shape – my dreams. From my early childhood, I’ve thought of my dreams as entertainments, stories, to be enjoyed as one might a movie. (I can to this day recall in considerable detail the dreams of ten, twenty, and thirty years ago – both awake, and when dreaming.) I used my dreams here as a form of escape – as I do the books I read (the latest: Mario Vargas Llosa’s Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, a marvelous tour-de-force) – especially during my stay downstairs in R-44 (the R-cells are known as “The Hole”), when there was little other means to pass the time. To dream was to be Outside again, for at least a while. But this morning I awoke from a series of dreams which centered around a common theme: my confinement here, and its depressing aspects.</p>
			<p>That kicked my emotional legs out from under me, underscoring the disappointments of the day. I have until now managed to avoid the depression that dominated the several months before I was sentenced. I took each day as it came, got along with my fellow inmates, and did not look ahead, content to serve my time and get it out of the way. I did not tease myself with the facts of my confinement – I did not look longingly out the cell window. I accepted the cellblock and its immediate environs as my home for the time being.</p>
			<p>In my dreams I was home, but only briefly, all too soon to return to confinement. There was a bittersweet quality to these dreams, and resentment as well. (In one I shared a narrow cot with my Pooh-cat, who in actuality died of old age, at 17, a few years ago. He crowded my legs. In reality, sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor causes my legs to ache in nearly every possible position before night’s end.) These dreams offered no escape, only a bitter reminder of my incarceration. </p>
			<p>Fortunately, today things changed again.</p>
			<p>This morning Asshole Steve went to court. This offered the rest of us the opportunity to discuss how we felt about him. Five of us – the original five – wanted him out. (Mike didn’t care.) We “wrote him out” on a Request Form, all five of us signing it. “He’s a liar, man,” Lonny said. It turned out Steve (who was also black) was the only reason Lonny wasn’t playing cards. (Phil and I had stopped playing cards when Steve was in a game.) “He’s always bragging about having the most money, the most women, the most of everything,” Jackson said, “but he’s too cheap to make any phone calls.” (Steve was always harassing the guards to be allowed to use a “free” outside phone – apparently none of his “many” friends would accept any more collect calls from him….)</p>
			<p>“This cellblock has the best reputation in the whole jail,” Wayne said, “and he’s ruining it.” (Steve was always bitching and moaning about something to the guards, had almost cost us our TV privileges one morning, and had actually filed a Grievance Form against one guard.) (Wayne was speaking the truth about A-7’s reputation among the guards – I’d heard it from several deputies myself.)</p>
			<p>We filed the request for Steve’s transfer to another cellblock this morning (you stick the Request Form through the door, and a guard takes it), and only a few hours later – early in the afternoon – a guard came and called “Payne, get your stuff together.” He’d been back from court only an hour or two – “All I gotta do is come up with sixty-five dollars, man, and I’m gone. I should get a check in the mail soon...” – and may have thought he was leaving. I pity his new cellmates.</p>
			<p>But with him, Wayne Treon also left – to become a Trusty. He’d received notice last week that, due to his application, he was on the waiting list. But we didn’t think it would happen so soon.</p>
			<p>Trusties get different – better – living quarters, with “real beds” and color TV, and can roam more or less at will within the jail. But – a large but – they work a 16-hour day. This may appeal to those who do not read and find confinement in a cellblock boring, but it does not appeal to me, since I am by nature indolent.</p>
			<p>I’ll miss the Big Guy. He was a genuinely nice man, with a good, if at times self-deprecating, sense of humor, and we had become good friends. He was also the “godfather” of A-7, the man who set the emotional tone for the block. We centered around him. (He was here for writing bad checks, a minor crime in my book – and, unlike Larry Janifer, who still owes me for the bad checks he hit me with in 1961, Wayne has been making restitution….)</p>
			<p>On the other hand, I inherited his cell – “C” cell – along with his oversize mattress. Yes, at last I have a “room of my own.” The “bed” is a concrete shelf with a mattress on it, but there’s a toilet, a sink, a chair – taken out to the day room for the day – and a desk-shelf unit fastened into the wall, into which I’ve put my books, and on which I’m writing this. It’s nice to have a place to put my things, to be able to leave my toothbrush and toothpaste on the sink, to be able to lie in bed and read – there’s a light right over my head there, perfect for reading – and to be able to sleep in relative darkness (I napped in here after dinner tonight). Altogether, this has really raised my spirits, especially since I hadn’t expected to get a cell for at least another month.</p>
			<p>For a few brief hours, Mike had the prospect of the day room for himself – as I had for two days when I moved to A-7. Then, this evening, just following my nap (it woke me up) two new men were moved up from DT. Both are quiet, middle-aged men. Chester is black and is waiting sentencing on his second DWI. The other, whose name I didn’t get yet, is white, a bit fussy, and a reader. I showed him my books. And now once again, We Are Seven. I feel like an old hand, now – and grateful that I’m off the floor at last.</p>
			<p>A mixed day, but an improvement over yesterday.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>September 26: Chester doesn’t play cards (I pity anyone in here who neither reads books nor plays cards – they have only the TV to help allay boredom) but Bill (the other new guy) does. Bill turns out to be 62 years old, and is in here for fraud (no other details volunteered). He plays well, but Jackson and I won three games of Spades, Phil and I won another Spades game, and I (for once) won the game of Hearts we played. (Thass me – a real winner….) </p>
			<p>It was, basically, a Good Day. Mike and I had several real conversations (my respect for him keeps going up) and although breakfast was lousy (no milk, no jelly for the toast), lunch (a bowl of good chili) and dinner (barbecued chicken, potatoes au gratin, peach cobbler) made up for it. (That was the best dinner I’d had here. “You’ve really adjusted to this place, Ted,” Phil said. “The food’s starting to taste good to you.” “My compliments to the chef,” I said.)</p>
			<p>Paul Williams sent six books from Arbor House, including his own book on Phil Dick, Only Apparently Real, which I particularly look forward to reading. Thanks, Paul. (Thanks also to Jay Kinney for Gnosis #2, which arrived earlier this week.) And Andy Porter sent the last three SF Chronicles – which, unfortunately, I’d already read. Topping off the mail were letters from Linda Pickersgill, Chuch Harris, and Phil Palmer, all of them a pleasure to read.</p>
			<p>But the overseas letters create a problem for me, since I cannot mail anything overseas from here. (I am allowed to buy, from the commissary, up to ten envelopes which are prestamped with 22 cents in postage [then the domestic first-class rate].) What I plan to do is to send my replies with this Letter to the Nielsen Haydens and once again presume upon their good will to remail those letters to their overseas recipients.</p>
			<p>I am enormously buoyed by the friendship I have been shown by so many of you, and the Nielsen Haydens in particular. Without their help (and that of Tom Weber and Victor Gonzalez) my incarceration here would be far less pleasant. Again, deep thanks.</p>
			<p>I slept better last night than I had on any previous night here. The cellblock has again settled down to quiet camaraderie. It’s jail, but it’s not that bad. I can live with it. (“I say, ‘live it, or live with it!’” – Firesign Theater.)</p>
