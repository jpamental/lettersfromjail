              <h1>Letters From Jail #3</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 15, 1986</h2>
			<p>It was a little after 9 PM, Sunday the 14th of September, when I called the NH’s for a little fannish gossip. Little did I realize. Tom Weber answered, but passed me over almost immediately to Teresa. Teresa’s voice sounded funny. “I don’t know how to tell you this, Ted,” she said.</p>
			<p>“Good news or bad news?” I asked, certain from the tone of her voice which it was.</p>
			<p>“Bad news,” she answered, confirming my impression. “Jerry Jacks is dead.”</p>
			<p>I heard her, but I barely comprehended what she said.</p>
			<p>“He died Friday,” she said.</p>
			<p>“How?”</p>
			<p>She told me what she knew, and told me there was a get-together going on right then at the Lupoffs’ for Jerry’s friends. We were still talking about that when a guard called me from my cellblock door. “White! You got a visitor.”</p>
			<p>I’d had several visits that weekend already. Michael Nally (a close friend, owner of Hole in the Wall Books in Falls Church, and my current employer-of-record) had been by early Saturday afternoon, followed later that afternoon by my business partner, Matthew Moore, and my daughter. Kit had returned Sunday afternoon with my mother. I wasn’t expecting any evening visits Sunday, but now I could guess who it might be.</p>
			<p>I was right: It was Dan Steffan, come to tell me the same news. “I wanted you to hear it from someone face-to-face,” he said.</p>
			<p>“I called the NHs,” I told him. “They could hardly keep it from me.”</p>
			<p>He nodded. We talked about what was known. “I talked to Grant (Canfield),” Dan said. “He and Paul Moslander found the body, after they got the landlady to let them in. They were going to take him to the hospital that morning.” Jerry had died suddenly, quickly, sitting in a chair at bedside, after stripping the sheets from his bed.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>I thought about how Jerry had sounded, the last time I’d talked to him, only a couple of weeks earlier. He’d down-played his own health problems, which had been recurring over the previous months. He was more concerned about my legal problems and enthusiastic about his plans to start a small videodisc company.</p>
			<p>I thought about the way I’d used his flat as a home base, all the times I’d been in San Francisco: The pleasant mornings in his all-white front room, bay windows overlooking Carl Street and the passing trolley cars, listening to compact-discs on his stereo and smoking companionably. I remembered the restaurants – his favorites – he took me to, the trips to the library for videotapes, to Tower Records for CDs; his love of San Francisco, the buildings he delighted in pointing out as we walked or rode past – his enjoyment of the city and his pleasure in communicating it. I recalled a dinner he’d cooked for Grant, the Lupoffs, and myself, and our care in selecting the wine that afternoon.</p>
			<p>When I think of San Francisco, I think of Jerry Jacks.</p>
			<p>When I think of Jerry Jacks, I think of the friendship, the comradeship, the love we shared. It’s very hard to realize he’s gone.</p>
			<p>When I got back to my cellblock, I called the Lupoffs. I talked to Dick, to Grant, and to Liz. They filled in missing details. An autopsy will be performed, but the feeling seems to be that it was AIDS. The first fan, the first close friend of mine, to be claimed by that disease.</p>
			<p>“He didn’t want to be put in a hospital and stuck with tubes and all that,” Grant said.</p>
			<p>“He lived the way he wanted to live, right up to the end,” Dick said.</p>
			<p>He lived the way he wanted to live – but what a shame it was cut so short. How glad I am that he made it to Corflu – the last time I saw him.</p>
			<p>“He changed in appearance the last few weeks,” Dick said, “losing a lot of weight in his face, his arms, and his legs. I think he knew.”</p>
			<p>“He refused to be tested for AIDS,” Grant said, “and he wouldn’t see a doctor. I think he knew what it was – he just wanted to go on living at home as long as he could.”</p>
			<p>“At least it was fast. It didn’t drag out over months or years,” I said.</p>
			<p>“Well,” Dick said, “he had all those recurring things – shingles, herpes on his face….”</p>
			<p>“I thought they were just separate things,” I said.</p>
			<p>“He didn’t have much strength – he tired easily,” Dick said, talking about his last few weeks. “But the important thing is that when he went, he went quickly. He may not have known at all. He just sat down and died.”</p>
			<p>I hope so. I hope his suffering was minimal. He deserved that, at least.</p>
			<p>Good-bye, Jerry. You were a good and valued friend.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>We have two new cellmates.</p>
			<p>Mike is a biker, in for parole violation and suffering a broken collarbone. “The fucking doctor wanted to put on an Ace bandage – can you dig that?” He has his left arm in a sling. He is in constant pain, his left shoulder as red as it would be from a severe sunburn. He is receiving minimal medication – no antibiotics, minor painkillers. He plays cards – very well – and only occasionally says, “Man, this really burns!”</p>
			<p>Like Charlie in A-5, he is not getting proper medical attention.</p>
			<p>Vitamin supplements are not available here either. Everyone farts a lot. It reminds you that this is a jail – we’re here to be punished.</p>
			<p>Steve is a Virginia Power employee – in here until his bond, $1,000, comes through. He expects to go home today. I hope so – it’s crowded in here now with three of us on the floor. (My only advantage is my relative seniority.)</p>
			<p>Lonny, in Cell D, hopes to leave today – he’s in court right now – and I hope he does. I want his cell. I want to sleep in a room of my own. Some nights the guards – officially they are Sheriff’s Deputies – come in every half hour, singing and joking, and making sustained sleep impossible. Two nights ago one stole cookies – purchased from the commissary and legally mine – from my paper bag. He missed the apple that was under my clean underwear. Although a few guards are decent guys, the majority are assholes – far worse in the way they treat us than our fellow inmates are. I suspect the job selects for this kind of person.</p>
			<p>When I moved into A-7 the inmates already here were:</p>
			<p>Phil – a white man, Vietnam vet, with blackouts, who assaulted someone and can’t remember it. He’s a country boy, reads his Bible regularly, and has a friendly twinkle in his eye. We get along very well.</p>
			<p>Wayne Treon – the other white man – weighs over 300 pounds, and is here for writing bad checks. I enjoy him. We occasionally have long talks.</p>
			<p>Jackson – a family man (he calls home every day) is very quiet, has a good sense of humor.</p>
			<p>Lonny – born in Louisiana, grew up in Chicago, boxed as a welter-weight and is still trim. He has a voice uncannily like Muhammad Ali’s and a sleepy smile. He wouldn’t play cards yesterday: “It’s bad luck the day before Court, man.”</p>
			<p>While it was just the five of us, we had a quiet, friendly cellblock. Mike’s a hardcase – and unlike the rest of us, not a first-timer (or, as Phil puts it, a “last-timer” – “I’m never coming. back here, man.”) – but he gets along well with the rest of us. There’s a camaraderie that functions among most inmates in here. We respect each other, treat each other decently. I hadn’t expected that, but it’s logical: we’re all in this together, and it’s a lot easier to get along with each other than not to. Blacks and whites, no matter what their prejudices Outside, have everything in common in here.</p>
			<p>The only example of prejudice I’ve encountered here was in A-5, from C.W. He’d misdealt a hand of Hearts, and when all but the last trick had been played, I was short a card – out of cards, in fact.</p>
			<p>“You a cheater, man,” he said, his voice bristling with resentment. (I’d taken the Queen of Spades and it had been a bad hand for me.)</p>
			<p>“Hey, man, don’t call me that,” I said softly. “You hurt my feelings.” </p>
			<p>“You white, ain’t you?” he responded. “You cheat.” </p>
			<p>Doc (Charlie) intervened. “You know how we say, ‘You in here, you a cheater – we all cheaters in here.’”</p>
			<p>“Yeah,” C.W. said, “we all cheaters in here, you a cheater, white boy.” But the situation had been defused. And two hands later C.W. reneged. B.B. leaned over to me: “You see how it is, man calls you a cheater because that’s what he is.” C.W. had thrown down his cards and left the game.</p>
			<p>A-5 was definitely rougher than A-7 – despite which, I got along there.</p>
			<p>I’ve been here eleven days. About 60 to go…that’s not too many.</p>
