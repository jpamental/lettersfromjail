            <h2>October 12, 1986</h2>
			<p>Lonny got Out last night. His official release date was today – a Sunday. Apparently they don’t release on Sundays (or holidays, which Monday is), so at a few minutes before midnight, while Bill, Phil, Mike, and I were playing Hearts and watching Saturday Night Live, a guard came to the door and shouted through it, “Ratcliff! Pack your things!”</p>
			<p>Lonny was asleep in his cell, and Phil kept laughing so much that he wasn’t sure if his leg was being pulled. But sure enough a few minutes later, after we’d all shook his hand, wished him luck, and offered some variation of “Now don’t you come back, you hear?” the guard took him out.</p>
			<p>I wonder about a system that dumps a big black man out on the street, homeless, at midnight on a Saturday night. (And I wonder if I’ll be given the same scant notice to call Michael Nally to come get me. He has my Honda and says he’ll come get me any time, day or night, but he lives an hour away, out in the Virginia countryside. Well, time enough to reach that bridge….)</p>
			<p>Yesterday was a strange day. The night before it got very cold in here: down to the mid-50s (F) in my cell, where I wore all my clothes under my sheet and blanket and was still cold. It’s the air conditioning, which stays far too cold, and blows a strong draft. Around 4 AM the fire alarm went off, ringing for ten minutes or more, and then ringing again for three shorter bursts. My assumption is that some poor fool got so cold that he set a fire in his cell. I couldn’t blame him if he did, but the alarm didn’t improve my sleep.</p>
			<p>Then when the mail came, they opened my mother’s letter and removed the stamps she’d enclosed. She had sent me, at my request, fifteen 17-cent stamps, to use on letters that might weigh over an ounce. “You can’t have these,” the guard said. “Why?” I asked. He gave me no reason, but just told me to put them in an envelope and he’d put them in my property. Later in the day another guard brought me a receipt for six stamps. Your guess about the whereabouts of the remaining nine stamps is as good as mine....</p>
			<p>I had two visits that afternoon, and while I was waiting in the corridor for the first, I listened to two inmates bullshitting. One, tall and thin, with wavy manicured hair, was going on about what a tough guy he was, and how he knew that you could take gunshots in the head because he’d known of a man who’d taken five .38 caliber shots (at close range) to his head and still taken out the would-be assassin (on Capitol Hill, no less), and of another “out in the desert” who’d survived three shots in the head. The other guy, much younger, a blond ex-Marine, reacted derisively, and said he’d volunteer to go out in the woods with the first guy, with one bullet apiece, and “take you out, man.” Naturally, the first man came back with, “Hell, I don’t need no bullet, and I’ll still get you!” The rest of us were much entertained by all this macho-Rambo crap.</p>
			<p>Michael Nally was my first visitor, and Matthew Moore my second. They each make a point of visiting every Saturday, which I appreciate. Matthew tells me that our band’s tapes are now being played regularly by three or four of the deejays at the U. of Maryland FM station, “Crimson Tide” being the current favorite, “Unanswered Questions” a close second.</p>
			<p>I called the Nielsen Haydens that evening, as pre-arranged, to work out Greg Pickersgill’s visit here, and talked briefly to Greg Himself. Later I called Victor Gonzalez in Seattle, and we chatted about fandom, music, and our personal lives (not that mine is all that interesting at the moment).</p>
			<p>I’ve noticed that if I don’t have a specific reason for calling someone it isn’t necessarily a good idea. “How’re you doing?” is a question I can answer only so many ways, so many times. There’s not much to talk about that doesn’t end up in these Letters anyway. I don’t like it here, but my dislikes are petty, taken individually. It’s the fact that I’m under others’ control – and the unreasoning petty bureaucracy of that control – that gets to me. “Assholes!” is our most common epithet for the deputies who run our lives here. They range from almost-decent human beings to petty tyrants – bullies, enforcing the letter of The Rules as they choose to see them. A number of them think it’s funny to try to provoke us into anger by teasing us. One, for example, opened a package of three books – from Avon; thanks John and Gary – and said, “I’ll give you this one, and keep these two,” giving me a sly look to see how I was taking it. Another took several letters I’d given him to mail, and said, “I’ll just throw these away, ha-ha. Here – ” to a passing Trusty, “you want ’em?” I keep a blank expression and say nothing, waiting them out. If I said it wasn’t funny, they’d just push it farther. What they hope is that I’ll snap and do something that would give them the excuse to beat me up and throw me in The Hole. I refuse to give them the satisfaction, but it has occurred to me that if I ever ran into one on the Outside, I’d love to kick the shit out of him. This is not a Good Attitude, of course, but it is a good example of the lessons they teach us here. (If I stay here long enough, they will make a criminal out of me, if only in self-defense.) No, that’s not something that makes for good phone conversations....</p>

			<p>October 14, 1986</p>
			<p>Two days have gone by without anyone new coming in to our happy little cellblock. I miss Lonny, but as time goes on, I find myself moving up the pecking-order. It’s little things: I used to bring cups of coffee or “juice,” etc., in for others. Now my tray, cup, etc., is, as often as not, brought to me.</p>
			<p>With Lonny gone there are only five of us who play cards, so we can’t form teams with the team who is sitting-out ready to play the winners of the last game, rotating us all. This has forced a readjustment in the way we rotate players, more informal and less certain.</p>
			<p>Wayne is still here, working as a Trusty, and needing $300 to get out. It looks like he’ll have to work it off in more time served. Poor guy. We see him in the hall, serving food occasionally, and swap a few words with him.</p>
			<p>And the evidence is that Asshole Steve is still here, too, in A-9. He needed (he said) only $65!</p>
			<p>Lynn Cohen at Marvel Comics has been sending Care Packages of comics in to me: three batches last week, and a batch of “Graphic Novels” that came today. (Mike Kaluta and Elaine Lee’s Starstruck is brilliant stuff – right up there with Mobius – although I found few connections with the original Elaine Lee play of the same name. On the other hand, Frank Miller and Bill Sienkiewicz’s Daredevil is pretentious, arty, and banal – a complete waste of paper. I haven’t read the rest yet.) In any case, my thanks to Lynn.</p>
			<p>And thanks also to Malcolm Edwards, who sent me Brian Aldiss’s Trillion Year Spree and Phil Dick’s Humpty Dumpty in Oakland from Gollancz. I’ve been reading the Aldiss at night – puts me to sleep quite readily....</p>
			<p>And so it goes....</p>
