              <h1>Letters From Jail #5</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 22, 1986</h2>
			<p>“White!”</p>
			<p>I look up from a card game, or maybe the book I’m reading. “Here!”</p>
			<p>The door had already buzzed open; the guard – a sheriff’s deputy, actually – looks at me for a moment. “Put your shoes on,” he says.</p>
			<p>I shuck off the “shower shoes” – white rubberoid flip-flops – and pull on the tennis shoes I was issued with my first set of prison clothes. The right shoe is missing its insole. The shoes close with Velcro straps, badly worn. I hike up my pants. They are too large at the waist, and I am not allowed a belt. The pants are dark blue, unhemmed at the cuffs, and worn quite thin. I exchange dirty pants and shirts on Sundays and Wednesdays for clean ones. Each time it’s a gamble. Each time I say “thirty-six,” and sometimes they fit. One time I was issued jeans that said “38” inside the waistband and had no pockets. That was after I’d rejected two 36s that were so tight at the waist that I couldn’t even zip up the flies. My shirt won’t button shut – there’s a two-inch gap. But it’s long-sleeved. Last time I had to settle for short-sleeved in order to get one I could button. There are long-sleeved shirts that fit me, but I usually have to try three or four to find one. The Trusty in the hall, shoving shirts in through the slot in the door, was too impatient this time. The shirts are light blue, with missing insignias over the pockets. From their shapes you can see that some said “Ford” and others “Chrysler”. The shirts are also worn and old, and come, like the pants, from a commercial work-clothes service.</p>
			<p>The deputy waits impatiently while I get ready, and lets me into the hall. I turn left and walk about 20 feet to where another hallway branches off to the right. I walk perhaps 30 feet down this hall, almost to the glassed door that signals its end, then turn left into a narrower corridor. This leads a short distance and turns right. Ahead is some new construction – a block wall on the right side that is yet unpainted. At the end is a locked door. On the left (older) wall of this final stretch of corridor is a window, closed with a slatted metal roll-down barrier. To the left of this window is a doorbell-type button. This is Property, and when the window is open one can see into the property room beyond.</p>
			<p>Opposite the Property window is a break in the corridor for an incongruously placed toilet, sink, and shower. One stops here and waits, and as perhaps a dozen men gather, some use the toilet. There is no privacy, but we are all used to that.</p>
			<p>We wait, and then the door opens. An inmate comes through it and walks between the waiting men, who lean against both walls of the corridor, leaving only a narrow passageway. The door opens again, and one or more others come through. Each time the heavy door slams shut.</p>
			<p>Then the door opens again, and a guard blocks it open. He consults a list, then calls off names. “Here,” “Yeah,” “Uh-huh,” we answer in turn. He disappears again, and more inmates come through the door, their visits over. Then the guard reappears, and again reads off the names. This time there is a number appended to each name. “White, eleven,” he says, and this time we file in turn through the door.</p>
			<p>On the other side of the door is another corridor, much shorter, and perpendicular to the one we’ve just exited. We turn left, and, at the end a few feet away, right. Before us are the visitation booths. It’s basically a long and relatively narrow room divided into 26 separate booths by narrow divider walls, thirteen on each side. They are numbered, and I find Number 11. Like the others, it is about four feet wide, with a swivel chair bolted to the floor, a counter, and, above that counter, a glass window. A telephone handset hangs on the divider-wall on the left. Beyond the glass is a mirror image of my booth, with the telephone on the right. One or two chairs sit there.</p>
			<p>My visitor pulls up his or her chair and picks up the telephone. I pick up mine. Not all work very well – there may be static, or a bad connection. Sometimes you can hear others’ conversations faintly. It’s safe to assume that a guard can eavesdrop, if he wishes.</p>
			<p>Another inmate’s girlfriend raised her blouse and revealed her breasts to her guy through the window. She was arrested on the spot.</p>
			<p>If we’re lucky, we get 20 minutes. Often, on Sundays, it’s less, due to the large number of visitors. When a visit is over, we return through the corridors, running the gauntlet of inmates waiting their turn, finding our way back to our cellblocks and awaiting a deputy to unlock our cellblock doors.</p>
			<p>It’s at once satisfying and frustrating. “It’s a jail, man.”</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Around 4:15 AM the cellblock door buzzes open and the door for “C” cell unlocks with a bang. “Treon!” a deputy shouts. “Time for yer fix!”</p>
			<p>Wayne Treon is heard groaning awake, dressing, pulling on his shoes. “Let’s go,” the deputy shouts impatiently. Mumbling to himself and blinking in the bright light of the dayroom, Wayne pushes his 300+ pounds out through the cellblock door, off for his insulin shot. This almost always awakens me, since I sleep on the dayroom floor. But as often as not I sleep through his return, a few minutes later. </p>
			<p>About 4:45 AM the little door in the cellblock door – 18 inches wide and 4 inches high – slams down into its horizontal position, projecting out into the hallway and becoming a miniature shelf. Sometimes an obnoxious guard will also bang several times on the door, making a loud noise and yelling, redundantly, “Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!” Noise is amplified by the painted bare concrete walls.</p>
			<p>From outside comes the sound of dishes clattering. Sometimes we wait ten minutes or more and sometimes there is no wait at all before a big metal cabinet – bigger than a refrigerator, and taller, with two vertical doors and an electrical cord dangling uselessly – rolls up. A door is opened; inside, metal trays sit in racks. One by one, they are pushed through the door-slot. I pull each one out and pass it on to Phil Funk, who passes or carries them on – three to the table, one to the floor for Mike Pendleton (who has a broken collarbone), and the rest to be carried back into the individual cells, which have all unlocked with loud bangs. After the trays of food come the metal cups of “coffee,” filled from a big plastic tub dipped into a huge metal pot by a Trusty who pours sloppily and fills the cups too full. They spill on the floor as we carry them. Last come the little cartons of milk. One of the Trusties tells Wayne, “Now, don’t eat the jelly on your tray,” in lecturing tones – he knows Wayne is a diabetic, and not much else.</p>
			<p>The metal trays have compartments. Sometimes these compartments hold a little jelly and two slices of buttered toast. Sometimes there is meat – sausage, scrapple, fried tongue, or fried bologna – or scrambled eggs. Once in a while there will be two hard-boiled eggs (which can be saved and eaten later as a snack). Occasionally there will be a bowl – metal or green plastic – a quarter-full of white sugar, with a box of cereal. Most of the time there is fruit of some kind on the tray – canned peaches, sliced pineapple, melon balls, or sections of orange and grapefruit. There may also be – instead of eggs or cereal – two pieces of French toast or two pancakes, swimming in cheap syrup. I always eat the fruit, and the toast with jelly, and drink the milk. I’ll eat the sausage, if there is any, but I avoid the rest, including the coffee, trading it if possible for more fruit.</p>
			<p>When we’re finished we stack the trays, bowls, and cups by the door on the floor. Unwanted food goes in the toilet.</p>
			<p>Then it’s back to bed for another three or four hours of sleep. I’m a light sleeper, but I’m learning to sleep through more and more noise. I often sleep through the gym call – which can come as early as 6:30, or as late as 8:30 – and today I slept through one inmate’s summons for court.</p>
			<p>Between 8:30 and 9:30, but usually around 9 AM, a guard pokes his head in and shouts, “Wake up, lock-out!” He may open each cell and repeat this admonition, and while most of the deputies are relatively good-humored about it, one was a real prick. Asshole Steve gave him some lip and he gave us virtually no time before closing the cells. This didn’t hurt me, but it caught several of the others off guard and their individual cells were locked before they’d had the chance to retrieve books, cigarettes, personal laundry (to be done that day), etc. Normally we have about ten minutes between the warning and actual lock-out. In that interval I get up and fold my mattress and bedding in half and wait until Phil is finished in his cell. Then I move my mattress into his cell, to be locked in. We’re allowed to keep out only our towels and pillows (sans pillowcases). We use the pillows to sit on, on the cold metal benches. (There are also four chairs which are brought out of the individual cells.)</p>
			<p>At lock-out the TV is turned on (from outside), and the other overhead light, along with the shower light and light over the toilet is turned on. We usually watch Love Connection, and then the various morning shows – often movies. The Fairfax Journal is delivered to each cell on weekdays, and I read that. The paper is almost wholly lacking in journalistic values (or virtues), smugly self-congratulatory, and carries very little news. Its half-page of comics has only one worth reading – “Steve Canyon” – and that hasn’t been very good lately.</p>
			<p>Lunch comes between 11 and 11:30. It consists of either a sandwich and a bowl of soup, or two sandwiches – one of which is always cheese – plus a metal cup of “juice” (watered and off-flavored Kool-Aid). Usually I prefer the soup and give away my sandwich (or save it for later), but yesterday the soup was lima bean, and tasted of tin or soap or something. No one could eat it – the whole cellblock dumped their soup in the toilet. (The best was chili – almost really good….)</p>
			<p>The afternoon is passed with more TV (The New Dating Game is a winner here, as is The Young and the Restless and afternoon movies) and cards. Today Phil and I won three games of Spades, and right now Steve, Mike, Jackson, and Wayne are playing Bid Whist, which I learned, but don’t enjoy that much. (Truthfully, I don’t like playing cards with Steve anyway – he’s aggressively nasty, he lies about what he supposedly bid, and probably cheats. When he’s in the game it loses its friendliness.) I read or write when not playing cards, rarely watching the TV more than casually. (When something is on that I want to watch either Steve or Mike get noisy or they change the channel, so I mostly ignore the TV.)</p>
			<p>Supper is served between 4:30 and 5:30, and is presaged by Wayne’s second insulin shot. Like breakfast, supper comes on metal trays, served from the big rolling, heated, metal cabinet.</p>
			<p>“Where’s my diabetic?” the Trusty yells, shoving through first a tray lacking in dessert. Or he’ll push through a regular tray and say, “Now don’t you eat that cake!” This meal is often accompanied by a salad, coffee, and “juice.” Wayne is given milk at both lunch and supper, but the rest of us get milk only at breakfast. The food varies between awful and edible. We trade around. I usually give Wayne my dessert – Wayne’s a generous fellow and shares his candy and cookies with me.</p>
			<p>After supper the cell-locks bang open like gunshots, and the guys with their own cells often go in and lie down for naps. At this point I pull my mattress out, and, if I’m tired, open it up and nap. I’ve managed to nap through Sunday-night, Monday-night, and Thursday-night football games, wild shouting and all. You learn to do it. If I don’t nap I’ll read, watch TV, play cards, or get into a conversation. I also help Wayne with his homework (he’s taking high-school equivalency classes, although he has a high school diploma already).</p>
			<p>Later in the evening, Mike, Phil, Wayne, and I play Hearts. I taught them the version I play, with the Jack of Diamonds Convention, and it makes for a good two-hour (or longer) game for us. Mike often wins, and Phil usually loses.</p>
			<p>Somewhere between 12:30 and 1:30 AM, the TV is turned off and lock-in occurs for those with their own cells. I may read a little before putting my shoes under the head of my mattress (to make up for a flat pillow), and going to bed. There are only a few hours to sleep before breakfast, and those hours will be punctuated every fifteen to 30 minutes by deputies entering the cellblock to shine their flashlights into each individual cell, “to make sure no one’s hanged himself” as conventional wisdom has it. I think it’s just harassment. They tend to be noisy, often singing loudly to themselves, or whistling, or talking loudly to someone still out in the hall. They slam the cellblock door loudly, and sometimes use our toilet, which flushes very loudly. One stole some of my commissary cookies – I heard him digging in my paper bag, but didn’t realize what he was up to. Lately I’ve been sleeping through these nocturnal visits: I’m adapting....</p>
			<p>Then, at 4:30, “Treon!” – and the cycle begins again....</p>
			<p>PS: I mentioned in an earlier letter that there are more than 300 inmates in this jail. Today I heard that the current number is 518. The jail was built for around 200.</p>
