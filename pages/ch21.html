            </header>
            <h2>November 11, 1986</h2>
			<p>We didn’t get much sleep last night. And we alternated between testiness and humor this morning. Last night was the weirdest and least pleasant since I’ve been here.</p>
			<p>Bernie Loeh went around the bend.</p>
			<p>It had become increasingly obvious that he was Not Right. Yesterday morning he’d been talking about how he hated to see his (ex-)wife naked. (And this from a man who took four or five showers a day and seemed eager to prance about naked, once telling a guard, from the shower, that he wanted to attend a naked church service.) “She’s real good lookin’ but I told her to put some panties on and throw a towel over her shoulder, and she’d look a lot better.”</p>
			<p>I injudiciously said, “To each his own.”</p>
			<p>That triggered an argumentative rant from him. “You don’t like that?” he yelled at me.</p>
			<p>“Did I say that?” I countered. “I said, ‘To each his own.’”</p>
			<p>We went back and forth on that about five times before he finally dropped it. Later on he could even boast, “I was testy this morning, but me and Ted, we worked it out.”</p>
			<p>Mainly what he worked was his mouth.</p>
			<p>“Mr. Kitherow, Mr. Kitherow?” he called through the door to a guard outside. “Bet I can tell you your wife’s middle name. Bet I can! Whadya say, is it a bet? Huh? It’s Gwendolyn, right?” (Apparently it was.) To Mike he said, “Know how many holes there are in that floor drain?” Mike guessed 60. “You’re close,” Bernie said. “You’re real close.” He shook his head in admiration. “Not counting the screw holes, there are 52 holes – just like in a deck of cards.” Today Chester, having heard that story for the first time, counted the holes in the drain. 52, plus two for the screws. “Ain’t that somethin’?” he said. “He right about that, anyways.” To another guard Bernie flashed a picture of Eisenhower and asked him to name who it was and the year in which he was most famous. </p>
			<p>He didn’t hold conversations. He conducted quizzes and he orated. He described working conditions on Texas prison farms (“They use three-word sentences”), and enumerated his objections to spending any time in a mental institution (as opposed to his perfect willingness to spend time in any jail): “They stick you in the ass with those needles.” He scribbled graffiti on the wall behind the toilet/sink, and on the wall over Phil’s bed, in Phil’s cell, while he was talking to Phil that evening.</p>
			<p>While Bernie was in Phil’s cell, Mike, Jack, and I discussed him. Mike and I have cells, but Jack had to spend the night out on the floor with Bernie. “That fucker don’t let me sleep,” Jack said. He said he just might do something about it. I told Jack that if he wanted to write Bernie out, I’d sign. My fear was that Bernie was going to bring the guards down on us. We had a quiet friendly cellblock, one with the best reputation in the jail with the guards. Bernie was attracting a lot more of their attention to us (every cellblock has a closed-circuit TV camera in it, by which the hall guards can monitor us); they were keeping a close watch on him. After supper, while Bernie was all but sermonizing on the subject of mental institutions, waving his arms excitedly, a guard popped in to ask, “Is everything all right?” (Bernie immediately told him an extravagant story, ending with, “You check out your Bible – Timothy I-dot-dot-2 – it’ll change your fuckin’ life!”)&#9;</p>
			<p>I went to bed around 11:30. An hour or two later I was awakened by the sound of the dayroom toilet flushing, and then the sound of Bernie’s voice, an intense low murmur. I didn’t hear anyone else (in addition to Jack and Bernie out on the dayroom floor, we had a black man named Joe, in for DUI, who had come in that evening) – just Bernie, rattling away. I drifted off, only to awaken to hear Bernie calling out to the guards, who were laughing in the hall, “Hey, you guys keep it down – we got guys trying to sleep in here!” Apparently he got into a conversation with one of them; I heard him asking one of his inane questions.</p>
			<p>Joe says Bernie offered him a cigarette, which he refused. “I turned my back on him – I just wanted to get to sleep.” Later he rolled over and saw Bernie kneeling over him, murmuring words at him. “I thought he was a queer,” Joe said. “If he’d made a pass at me, I’d a slugged him.”</p>
			<p>Jack says he never got to sleep. “I told him, ‘Keep quiet!’ three or four times,” he said, “I was ready to lay him out.” Jack is about half Bernie’s size.&#9;</p>
			<p>I may have dozed off again, but around 3:00 AM his voice woke me again, and this time it was much louder. He was making no effort to keep it down. I have no idea who he was talking to. It might have been himself – he had gotten himself really wound up.</p>
			<p>“Shut the hell up!” I said, giving vent to my growing irritation.</p>
			<p>In the next moment he was outside my locked cell door. “What’d you say, you motherfucker?” he demanded.</p>
			<p>“I said to shut your goddamned mouth,” I said.</p>
			<p>“You shut up, faggot!” he shouted.</p>
			<p>“Ain’t you got no respect?” I said. “Running your mouth all night, how you expect people to sleep?”</p>
			<p>“Why don’t you come out here and say that, you dirty dope-dealer?” he demanded. “You goddamned filthy muther, you come out here, so’s I can smash your face in!”&#9;</p>
			<p>We both knew the door was locked and neither of us could open it.</p>
			<p>“I’m gonna be right here when this door opens – two or three hours from now. I’ll be right here,” he promised. “You fuckin’ slimey dope dealer! I know all ’bout you – selling that cocaine to little kids. I’m gonna beat the shit outta you! I’m gonna teach you, boy! Pushers like you are the scum of the earth! Yeah, I’m right here, waiting for breakfast to come, waitin’ for that door of yours to pop right open!”</p>
			<p>Shit, I thought. That’s all I need. Get in a fight and you go to the Hole and your time’s extended. I’m about three weeks from release, and this has to happen! At the same time I was thinking about what I would have to do when the cell doors unlocked. I decided that since the door swung outward I’d slam it into him and then hit him with my chair. I was sure his strength was greater than mine – a crazed person is usually stronger and less able to feel pain – and the only way I could match him would be to get really angry, a towering rage. Well, I was pissed, but not anything like that angry.</p>
			<p>“You better shut up,” I told him, “or they’re gonna put you back in the Hole!”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes!” he said. “I’ll go in the Hole all right! I don’t mind! I’ll take you with me, cocksucker!” He banged on my door some more and continued ranting. He’d worked himself up with some kind of moral outrage over my alleged cocaine sales to children (which, in retrospect, pissed me off more than anything else he said) and had by now convinced himself that it was his holy mission to wipe the floor with me.</p>
			<p>At that point the lieutenant came in. “Pack your stuff and let’s go,” he said.</p>
			<p>“What?”</p>
			<p>“Pack up your stuff, please.”<br /><br />”What about this dope dealer? You gonna let him just sit in there like that? He sold cocaine to little kids!”</p>
			<p>“Come on, let’s go. Pack your stuff.” </p>
			<p>“Don’t rush me now!”</p>
			<p>“Let’s go. Pack it up!”</p>
			<p>“Say ‘please.’ I didn’t hear you say ‘please.’”</p>
			<p>“I’m not going to tell you again – pack it up!”</p>
			<p>“You gonna make me? Huh? You gonna make me? I gotta good mind to hit you – !” </p>
			<p>I didn’t see this. But I heard more guards running in and the sounds of a scuffle. By the time I had my glasses on and was standing by my door, looking out, four or five deputies had Bernie on his stomach on the floor, the lieutenant standing over them, and they were putting leg-shackles and handcuffs on him.</p>
			<p>“Oh, that cold floor feels good,” Bernie said, almost in a croon. “Hard and cold – just like my second wife!” </p>
			<p>“You going to stop this stuff and settle down?” one of the deputies asked.</p>
			<p>“Hell no,” Bernie said, still struggling. “You gonna have to do it right! You know, I’m gonna get a job as a deputy, you know that? Then I’ll show you how it’s done!”</p>
			<p>By then both Jack and Joe had moved to the far end of the room, and the deputies were packing up Bernie’s few possessions. “This your book?” one of them asked him. It was a book I’d loaned to Bernie two days earlier – which Bernie had never cracked – Heartland, by Robert Douglas Mead.&#9;</p>
			<p>“Nah, that’s that goddamned gray-haired dope dealer’s book! You know, he sleeps ten hours a day, has all that money – ’cause he sells that fuckin’ dope to little kids! That’s a Western book, an’ he ain’t never been west of nowhere!” Still ranting nonsense about me, Bernie was hoisted to his feet and taken out. Back to the Hole. “Tell that dope dealer,” he called back, “if I ever see him in the hall, I’m gonna give him a kiss – like a goddamned Georgia whore!”</p>
			<p>“Hey, Jack,” I said through my door, “You got any idea what time it is?” Jack went to the hall door and looked at the clock in the barbershop.</p>
			<p>“It’s 3:15,” he said.&#9;</p>
			<p>We all tried to go back to sleep. I found it impossible. And so, I discovered at breakfast, had everyone else – except Chester, down in the A-cell, who had somehow slept through it all. (“Where Bernie at?” he asked, looking around.) Phil, Jack, Mike, and I lingered, after breakfast, talking about it.</p>
			<p>“He was going to punch that lieutenant,” Phil said. “I’m standing right there, looking through my door, and they’re not two feet away from me. ‘I’ll hit you,’ he says to the lieutenant, and I believe he would’ve if they hadn’t wrestled him down on the floor right then!”</p>
			<p>Mike said, “I was laughing. I was watching them and laughing like a motherfucker.” I’d heard him. “I went back to bed, I couldn’t get back to sleep,” he continued. “I like to beat my peter for an hour, an’ it stayed limp.” He shook his head in wonder.</p>
			<p>“I ain’t got no sleep yet,” Jack said. After half an hour or so of ventilating our feelings, we all went back to bed. I drifted off about half an hour before lockout.</p>
			<p>It was a strange day – and got stranger. Joe Love rejoined us from the Dispensary in the afternoon. Jack looked disgusted. “Here’s the snorer,” he muttered. Joe listened in amazement as we told him about Bernie.</p>
			<p>Then, around 4:45 – around dusk (on a gray rainy day) – the fireworks occurred: The transformer outside blew up.</p>
			<p>The transformer sits by itself about ten feet from the jail, and about fifteen feet below our window, directly opposite our cellblock. There was a low boom! and a fountain of sparks shot twenty feet into the air – a spectacular view from our window. Our lights and TV went off, our night lights cutting back on a moment later when the emergency generator kicked in. (The lights in my cell were dim red glows.) When the fireworks were over we could see a hole in the ground next to the transformer, from which smoke still wafted.</p>
			<p>Supper – fried chicken – was an hour late. The elevator was out and the kitchen staff had to take all the meals up the stairs by hand to the B floor. Ours were nearly cold, but we were glad to get them. After supper I went into my dark cell and straight to bed, exhausted. It had been more than enough excitement for one day.</p>
			<p>#&#9;</p>
			<p>[Six and a half years later, I still vividly remembered and wrote about my departure from jail:]</p>
			<p>Postscript </p>
			<p>They release their prisoners from the Fairfax Adult Detention Center at about 4:30 AM – or at least begin the procedure then – and the scuttlebutt was that this is done to save feeding them a final meal. Breakfast is brought to the cells between 5:00 and 5:30 AM.</p>
			<p>I woke up some time before that – maybe 3:30; I couldn’t see a clock – and couldn’t go back to sleep. I had done all my packing the night before. There had been a lot of kidding with Mike and Phil about my getting out. “I’m gonna have to pop you one,” Mike told me. Being involved in a fight – even as a victim – would put an end to my release and get me thrown in the Hole (solitary). Of course, popping me one would get Mike thrown in the Hole, too, and we both knew he was just joking; jail joking. They were glad for me, and envious.</p>
			<p>With nothing else to do, I turned on my light and read a book, a series Western that I never finished and have since forgotten. And around 4:30 they came for me – me, and another fellow, a big guy in for just the weekend, who had held himself aloof from us common criminals, refusing to play cards with us. As we waited, he told me his car was parked several miles away, and he wondered how, at this hour of the morning (no buses running yet), he’d get to it. He obviously didn’t want to walk it.</p>
			<p>I had a different problem. I had too much stuff. Even leaving behind many of my books, I had all I could carry just leaving my cell. Property had another couple of boxes of books which I would have to pick up when I got to that point, and I just wouldn’t be able to carry it all. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, my friend Matthew Moore was coming to pick me up with his car. “I’ll give you a ride to your car if you’ll carry some boxes for me,” I told the big guy. He agreed. His car was parked along the route we’d take home, so I wouldn’t be forcing Matthew to go out of the way.</p>
			<p>The two of us joined a short line at Property, where we were given back our own clothes and quickly stripped off our jail garb (old, threadbare blue shirts and pants, once worn by service-station attendants and owned by a commercial linen service before they were sold or donated to the jail). I was given the remaining boxes of my books being held by Property. Then we joined the line again and were led downstairs.</p>
			<p>This was the first time I’d been back to that level since my own days in solitary (though which one passes before being placed in the general population). I’d forgotten the smell, which made my stomach turn. We were taken back to one of the holding cells in which I’d first been held. We were a group of about half a dozen, and they kept us separate from the newcomers in adjacent holding cells. One by one we were taken out of the cell and up to the main desk, where we were again photographed, our paperwork checked and completed, and then it was back again into the holding cell. Since I’d left my cellblock at 4:30 it had taken about an hour to process me to this point. But that was just about it.</p>
			<p>They took us into a small square room just a little bit bigger than a large elevator car, locking the doors behind us before unlocking a different set of doors in an adjacent wall, and ushering us through them.</p>
			<p>That was it. Once we stepped through that second set of doors we were free. We were in a public hall. And at the other end of the hall, beaming to see me, was Matthew.</p>
			<p>It was early December, and I was dressed as I had been three months earlier, in early September. It didn’t matter. We dropped off the big guy at his car (without even mugging him – but he seemed grateful to see the end of us even so). Dawn was lighting up the eastern sky as I walked into my house, and thanked Matthew. My car was parked in the drive; Michael Nally, who had kept it for me at his place out in the country, had brought it back the day before. I was home.</p>
			<p>I couldn’t decide what I wanted to do first. I skimmed through a huge stack of mail. I turned on the TV set – every set in the house – to NBC’s Today show. I took a Pepsi out of the fridge and drank it (my first in three months – and the only thing to which I am truly addicted). I undressed and went to bed. I couldn’t sleep. I got up and took a bath and trimmed my mustache and beard. (My facial hair had grown untrimmed for three months: I looked like Santa Claus). I bounced from one thing to the next. I came back to my mail and read some of it. I turned off the TV and put on a CD. The clean sounds of well reproduced music that I liked filled the room. I went back to bed and got back up again. It was mid-morning by then, so I dressed and began to get back into the rhythms of a normal day. Later I wrote a letter to Lynda, my first as a free man.</p>
			<p>I went back to the jail only once, a few days before Christmas. I wanted to leave ten dollars, as a Christmas present, for Mike, who I knew had little money in his commissary account. But they told me Mike was gone, “down the road” already, to a downstate prison. He was a state prisoner (as I had been) with more than a year of time to do, so his stay in the Fairfax jail had been temporary. Wanting to leave the money for someone, I asked if Phil was still there, and when they said he was, I put it into his commissary account. Later I wondered if that had been a good idea. Phil had been moneyless – his was a heartbreaking story of compounded bad luck that included losing a house he had built when pest-exterminators poisoned it with chemicals which caused nerve damage to his entire family – and prisoners with no money in their commissary accounts were given certain items like toothpaste and toiletries free. Would my gift of ten bucks jeopardize his situation? I never found out.</p>
			<p>I had been turned in to the police by two neighbors – the people who lived next door, across my driveway, and the people who lived diagonally across the street. They had tipped the police almost a year before my arrest; I had been under police surveillance since May of 1985 – virtually the beginning of my Life of Crime as a Dealer. The police report left in my house after my arrest was missing its first page, but detailed the relentless demands of my next-door neighbor to “do something” about me. He wrote down the license number of every car that pulled into my drive. Since virtually none of my customers parked in my drive, the numbers he turned in were those of my mother, members of my band, members of my writers’ group (The Vicious Circle), and associated other friends, like, say, Avedon. Maybe that’s what slowed the cops down.</p>
			<p>That missing first page named my other neighbors and probably was omitted at their request. But they foolishly smoked dope (!) with, and bragged about how they’d “gotten” me, to a friend of a friend, and of course I heard about it.</p>
			<p>It must have freaked them all when I showed up again after only three months in jail, and they must have wondered what revenge I might take upon them. I’d seen them in court; they knew I’d seen them.</p>
			<p>I’d had time to think about the situation during those three long months. Naturally I resented them. I resented their dishonesty – pretending friendship with me while trying to have me arrested – more than anything else. I didn’t exactly hold it against them that I had been arrested – that after all was because I’d broken the law – but their eagerness to have me arrested and their gleeful reaction to my arrest, when I had never been anything but a good neighbor to them certainly pissed me off. (My customers, mostly middle-aged, middle management types, although I did have a defense analyst from the Pentagon, and a member of the Redskins coaching staff, did nothing to annoy the neighbors.) While I was in jail, friends suggested they might indulge in some high-spirited Halloween pranks at my neighbors’ expense, but as far as I know, nothing actually occurred.</p>
			<p>Well, I wanted some sort of revenge or retribution, but I was keenly aware of the disadvantage I was at. I was then on parole, and when that ended I had nine years of probation – a suspended sentence which I would have to serve if I got into any further trouble.</p>
			<p>My neighbors knew this too, apparently. They tried to get me in trouble with my parole officer by complaining first to the City of Falls Church that I had derelict, junked cars on my property, and then by trying to use this supposed infraction of a municipal law to have my parole revoked. I know this because I had to deal with the City about it and my parole officer told me about their attempts to revoke my parole – which failed. I went over the head of the petty city official who was trying to get me (as a favor to my neighbors), and had the case against me dropped, while my parole officer took one look at the actual situation and laughed at the absurdity of it (no derelict, junked cars).</p>
			<p>So here were nasty, still vengeful neighbors, maybe frightened by and certainly annoyed by my return and my continued presence next door to them, plotting to have me put back in jail again. What could I do?</p>
			<p>I knew that whatever I did I could not escalate this situation. If I did something to them, they’d just do something else back. That would be a karmic trap. What I needed was a Karmically Correct solution – something that would not rebound to harm me, something which would keep my hands clean, both morally and legally.</p>
			<p>I found it. They thought the worst of me, and they feared the worst of me. That was what was eating them. They knew I’d take revenge on them. They would, in my shoes. They had guilty consciences.</p>
			<p>So in February I sent both sets of neighbors valentine cards. These were “joke” valentines, the slightly nasty kind, but nothing specifically threatening. I signed them, “the White family.” I planned to send similar cards on each appropriate occasion – Easter, Mother’s Day, the whole lot.</p>
			<p>The day I intended to mail the cards I noticed a “Hagar the Horrible” strip in that day’s paper. It was a two-panel strip, and I shall have to try to remember it since I no longer have it. In the first panel Hagar is instructing his son, and is saying something like, “There are two ways to look at revenge.” In the second panel Hagar gleefully says, “And I’m for it!” or something like that.</p>
			<p>I cut out the strip, separating the two panels. I put one panel inside the card to one of my neighbors, and the other panel inside the card to the other neighbor. And then I mailed them.</p>
			<p>Their reaction was considerably greater than I expected, satisfyingly so. Three days later I answered my door to find two uniformed Falls Church City cops standing there. One of them had both of my cards in his hand. “Did you mail these?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Sure,” I said. “What’s the problem?”</p>
			<p>“Well,” he said, in a not-unfriendly tone of voice, “I wonder if you could tell me why you sent them.”</p>
			<p>I told him. I told them both the exact truth of the situation, straight-up: Just why I’d sent them and what I had hoped to provoke. “I wanted to feed their paranoia and let them do it to themselves,” I said, “and I’d say I was pretty successful if they called you,” I concluded.</p>
			<p>Both cops laughed out loud. “That’s pretty good,” the one who was holding the cards said.</p>
			<p>“I got no problem with it,” the other cop said, grinning. “Have a good one,” he added, as they left, still laughing.</p>
			<p>The cops’ visit told me several things, or confirmed them. It confirmed my neighbors’ collusion: they had obviously compared cards and put the two panels of the “Hagar” strip together. And they were alarmed, indeed fearful enough to call the police – although what they expected the police to do is hard to guess. My cards had gotten a bigger reaction than I’d expected, and it was obvious that there was no reason to send more.</p>
			<p>I don’t know what the police told my neighbors, but a few months later my neighbors across the drive sold their house at a loss and left. I hear she left him at the same time. They’d never really been married; only pretended to be. As for my neighbors diagonally across the street, the ones who also smoked dope but were so self-righteous about my dealing it, he died painfully a few years ago of cancer (I hope he used marijuana to cope with the chemotherapy) and she has tried to suck up to me in an attempt to resume the apparent friendship we’d enjoyed before my arrest. I am polite to her, but distant. And the people who bought the house across the drive turned out to be the nicest people and best neighbors I’ve ever had.</p>
			<p>And there it ends. </p>
