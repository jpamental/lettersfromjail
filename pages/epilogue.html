			<p>But not quite. There is still more.</p>
			<p>My arresting detective was a man named Philip Hannum. He did a lot of strutting and posturing. At one point he told me I was unfit to be a father. He told me that with great moral indignation. </p>
			<p>But Hannum was also a liar, who perjured himself in court, claiming to have taken evidence (drugs) from a refrigerator on my porch. After that court session, while my lawyer and I waited for the elevator, Hannum and his partner, Lt. King, joined us. So I asked him, “With all you got against me, why lie about more?” This made him very indignant and he took us to where his police vehicle (a Volvo station wagon) was parked. The back of the wagon held a lot of paper grocery bags, all labeled, all evidence. After warning us not to approach the car, he began rooting among the bags to show us the one with stuff he’d taken from my porch refrigerator. He couldn’t find it, despite swearing it was there. “You must be crazy if you think I’d store anything of value on my front porch,” I told him.</p>
			<p>This was not to be my last brush with detective Hannum. </p>
			<p>On March 15, 1987, I married Lynda Magee and in the process acquired two step-children, her daughter Rayne (one year younger than my daughter) and her son, Spencer (who was eight when I first met him). When Spencer had his next birthday (in February) the following year, we threw a party for him and he invited his new friends, most of them school classmates. Only one did not come. He turned out to be Philip Hannum’s son. His father would not allow him to come to my house. His father was convinced I’d “get back at him” through his son. Frankly, the thought had never entered my mind, and until the invitation was declined I hadn’t been aware of the kid’s last name or connection to my former arresting officer.</p>
			<p>Spencer and Hannum’s son remained good friends, however. And one day some time after the birthday incident Spencer told me that his friend and the boy’s mother had left Hannum. It seems Hannum was an alcoholic who would go into drunken rages and had physically abused both his wife and his son on a number of occasions.</p>
			<p>Think of that.</p>
			<p>Oh, and one more thing: Detective Hannum was removed from the Falls Church police force for unspecified reasons at some point around the time his wife and son left him. The police have refused to discuss Hannum’s departure from the force, but confirm that the decision was not his.</p>
			<p>Ah, karma....</p>
