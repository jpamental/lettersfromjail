            <h2>October 27, 1986</h2>
			<p>It was about 10:30 this morning and I was playing Hearts when a black deputy – a sergeant – opened our cellblock door and called “White?”&#9;<br /></p>
			<p>I looked up. “Do I need my shoes?” I was wearing my “shower shoes” — rubberoid slippers – and they usually insist you wear shoes when you go to class, gym, or a visit.</p>
			<p>&#9;</p>
			<p>“No, just put your shirt on,” he said.<br /></p>
			<p>I slipped my blue short-sleeved shirt over my long-sleeved thermal undershirt, and followed the deputy out into the hall, wondering what this was going to be about. It was outside the routine, and that can make you nervous. (The last time something outside the routine happened to me, it was my transfer from A-5 to A-7. That was an improvement. What would this be?)</p>
			<p>The deputy led me down the hall to a desk located opposite A-10 in the hallway.</p>
			<p>“Have a seat,” he said, gesturing to a chair beside the desk and sitting himself in the chair in front of the desk. He consulted a form. I could see the Virginia state seal at its top.<br /></p>
			<p>“You’re going to receive your Mandatory Parole on December 4,” he said.</p>
			<p>“That’s sooner than I expected;” I said, feeling a rush of exhilaration. “Can you tell me when on the fourth I’ll be released?”<br /></p>
			<p>“Five-thirty,” he said.</p>
			<p><br />”One of our guys was released at midnight,” I said. “That’s why I wondered.”<br /></p>
			<p>“If it’s a weekend, they release you at midnight,” he explained. “Weekdays, five-thirty in the morning.” Then he proceeded to ask me questions and fill out the form. The questions were: “Do you have anyone to stay with, when you get out?” “At what address?” “What was your previous address?” “Do you have a job waiting for you?” and “What’s your employer’s address?”&#9;</p>
			<p><br />He gave me a slip of paper with my state number (#149676) on it, “MPD 12/4/86,” and the phone number of my parole board. “They’ll tell you, when you’re released, that you have three days to get in touch with your parole board,” he said.</p>
			<p>That was pretty much it. He wished me luck and led me back to my cellblock where I resumed the Hearts game (Mike won).</p>
			<p>December 4th is a Thursday. I’ll be out that morning! (I’ve heard they don’t like to feed you the day they release you. That’s fine with me.) Receiving definite news like this is great. As of now I have only slightly more than a month to go. (And this letter, at the rate they’ve been getting published, may well not reach most of you until after that date. I suspect I may not bother writing many – or any more….)</p>
			<p>I called Michael Nally, who has my Honda, and he said it would be back in my driveway at the beginning of the week. And I called Matthew Moore, who has a key to my house, and he agreed to pick me up here on the 4th. “I’ve got the schedule for it,” Matthew said, laughing. (He works nights for CSPAN, the cable broadcaster that covers Congress.) Then I called Dan Steffan, who said he hoped I didn’t want to play Pinochle that night (“traditionally” Thursday nights were Pinochle nights at the Steffans’). “I haven’t played any in here,” I said wistfully. </p>

			<p>Bill left us this morning – at about 4:30 AM. The guard’s voice woke me up: “Lee-may?” Bill’s last name is Leamey, pronounced “Lee-me,” but all the guards habitually mispronounced it and often couldn’t find it on their lists when Bill pronounced it correctly for them. By now he was used to it. </p>
			<p>“Leamey?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Get your things,” the guard said.</p>
			<p>“All of my things?” Bill asked. “Where am I going?”</p>
			<p>“I dunno, “ the guard said. “Maybe you’re going home.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I doubt that,” Bill said. He had a five-year sentence.</p>
			<p>“He went ‘down the road,’” is what we told the guy from Commissary when he arrived later that morning with our orders and asked for Bill.</p>
			<p>“Give me his candy bars!” Mike demanded. Bill owed candy bars on the outcomes of both the World Series and the Giants–Redskins game the night before. But Sgt. Thompson, who runs the Commissary, just laughed at him.</p>
			<p>“Down the road” means a downstate prison or camp. Bill was 62, and had colitis (which caused him to make almost liquid-sounding farts, to everyone’s amusement but his), so it’s likely he went to a “medical camp” where the duty would be light.</p>
			<p>He didn’t like to discuss his case, but revealed that he was a retired federal employee who had gotten into real estate speculation. Like those pitchmen on late-night “television seminars,” he tried to do it without using his own money – he mentioned having six mortgages on one piece of property – and had extensive landholdings. But he cut it a little too close, and was found guilty of fraud. While he was in here half a dozen civil suits were filed against him. I suspect he’ll be stripped and financially ruined before he gets out (a matter of a year or so), as a result of those suits, but he was almost unfailingly cheerful.</p>
			<p>He sometimes annoyed me with his chirpy good cheer, and he was notable for his absent-mindedness in card playing (“You mean I still had the Queen of Spades? I thought I gave it to you!”), but he was a civilized man, a rarity in here, and I find I miss him.</p>

			<p>Chester finally got a look at Susie today. “Who is that?” he asked. “That a girl or a boy?”</p>
			<p>“That’s Susie,” Jackson said.</p>
			<p>“That’s a he-she,” Mike said.&#9;</p>
			<p>Chester shook his head. This was totally beyond his comprehension.</p>
			<p>A-4 is the gay cell and today they were getting their hair cut in the barbershop across the hall from us. I heard noise in the hall and wandered to the door to see what was going on. One looks for diversions. </p>
			<p>“Susie’s getting her hair cut,” I announced.</p>
			<p>“Come on, Chester, you gotta see this,” Mike said, laughing.</p>
			<p>“Why do I want to see some goddamned queer?” mumbled Chester.</p>
			<p>“Come on, man, you ain’t gonna believe this,” Mike said. He nudged Chester.</p>
			<p>And Chester didn’t believe what he saw, either.</p>
			<p>Susie is amazingly androgynous, with a small (five feet tall) body and an almost pretty face. “She” has a feminine voice, chats animatedly, sometimes wears a ponytail, and acts girlishly. I was told “she” had performed a grisly surgery upon herself, cutting off her testicles, and that “she” wanted to be a transsexual.</p>
			<p>I was introduced to Susie when I was in A-5, which faces the psychologist’s office across the hall. One day Susie was in that office, the door open, chatting away with the female psychologist, and the guys in A-5 noticed. “Hey, there’s Susie!” they said. “You gotta see this, Ted.”</p>
			<p>I was astonished to see someone so blatant in a jail. “That must take guts, to come on like that in a place like this,” I commented.</p>
			<p>“You kiddin!?” was the reply, “she loves it.”</p>
			<p>Apparently that’s true. Despite the fag-baiting talk one hears so much of here, Susie seems to inspire admiration and perhaps even lust. One day when I went up to gym she was holding court in the hallway outside the volleyball area, surrounded by five or six men, and chatting away animatedly as usual.</p>
			<p>Susie gets along well with the guards – who sometimes have late-night parties in the hall with her, parties which used to keep me awake when I slept out on the floor. One wonders about the sexual favors dispensed at such parties.</p>
			<p>“That looks like a girl to me,” Chester said. “You sayin’ that ain’t no girl?” For once his confidence in his own ignorance was shaken. He couldn’t take his eyes off Susie. He shook his head. “If that don’t beat all!” he said. “She pretty!” </p>

			<p>November 1, 1986</p>
			<p>Last night I dreamed about jail. This is the first time in more than a month that I did. I dreamed I was out for the day, but had to go back, or I’d be considered a fugitive. To get back, I had to find my way through a fundamentalist Christian encampment of some sort – very gaudy, almost circus-like. As I got closer to the jail I had to take my belt off, roll it up, and find a place to hide it where it would be safe. I don’t think I ever got all the way back to the jail, but in a later episode of my dream I recall explaining to a friend my sleep schedule: “It’s all supervised,” I said. “I have no choice!”</p>
