              <h1>Letters From Jail #18</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>November 4, 1986</h2>
			<p>We had a cellblock shakedown today. No particular reason – just “routine.”</p>
			<p>The tipoff occurred, had I but recognized it, at lockout. “We’re taking that extra mattress today,” the asshole guard said as I started to get out of bed.</p>
			<p>I’ve had two mattresses since I moved into this cell, and for a good reason. The mattress I had, out on the floor, was relatively new, and relatively thick, but short and narrow. The mattress in the cell I acquired was longer and wider, but worn very thin in the middle. I’d gotten Wayne’s cell, and Wayne weighed over 350 pounds. Wayne had slept on that mattress since March – more than six months. I put the smaller, thicker mattress under the bigger, thinner one. Together, they were fairly comfortable, relatively speaking. I slept almost well, considering that I was sleeping on mattresses with almost no “give” lying on a concrete shelf.</p>
			<p>The morning before the shakedown did not pass without event. I was in the middle of a game of Hearts when the door opened and a guard called, “White! You got a visit!” It wasn’t visitor’s hours, so when I went out I asked what kind of visit it was. “Professional visit,” I was told. That meant my lawyer.</p>
			<p>As I went upstairs I wondered why my lawyer was visiting me. Today marked the day on which exactly one month of my time was left. Was there a new charge? (I’d heard “nolI prossed” charges were not truly dropped, but just tabled, and could be revived. I’d had three charges nolI prossed. Could they have been revived? Was the state playing games with me? It had happened to others. Some prosecutors are sadists – they like to let you get close to freedom before slamming the door in your face again. I’ve even heard of inmates being re-arrested upon their release.)</p>
			<p>The professional visitation area is just beyond the (new) regular visitation area. It consists of six or eight little bare “office” cubicles, separate rooms, furnished with a desk and two chairs. I guess lawyers don’t feel comfortable without a desk to sit behind. I was put in an empty room, to await my lawyer. Another inmate, who had come up with me, was shown into a room where a young curly-haired lawyer was waiting for him. “Your lawyer will be coming along shortly,” the guard who’d put me in the room said. So I waited there.&#9;</p>
			<p>After ten minutes the guard came back. “He’s not here,” he said. “I guess he didn’t show.” He ushered me back to the hallway outside the regular visitation area. I trudged back down the stairs to A-floor, and my cellblock. </p>
			<p>“False alarm,” I said, picking up my hand of Hearts. The game resumed. </p>
			<p>A hand later, the cellblock door again opened. “White! Professional visit!”&#9;</p>
			<p>“Again?” I asked, as I left the cellblock. “They found him,” the guard said. </p>
			<p>So once more I climbed the stairs, went down past the row of B-cells; nodded at the guard at the desk in the hallway (“I’m back,” I told him), and headed down to the professional visitation area.&#9;</p>
			<p>The guard who’d been there before met me again. “He’s the same one,” he said, nodding his head toward the curly-haired lawyer I’d seen before. “He’s got both of you. You should’ve waited.”</p>
			<p>“What for?” I said. “He’s not my lawyer.”</p>
			<p>The lawyer, in turn, gave me a blank look and asked the guard, “Where is he?”</p>
			<p>“This is White,” the guard said.</p>
			<p>“Geoffrey White?” the lawyer said.</p>
			<p>“No,” I said, “I’m Theodore White.”</p>
			<p>“This is the wrong man,” the lawyer said, displaying a brilliant grasp of the obvious.</p>
			<p>Once again I trudged back to my cellblock. Lunch was being served. The hall guard made me sit on a bench in the hall and wait until all the A-cells had been served, and then gave me two sandwiches (cheese and liverwurst), a small bag of potato chips; and a metal cup of “juice.” Once I had these all in my hands, he had the door unlocked and allowed me to fumble it open. Inside, everyone else was nearly finished eating. “Another false alarm,” I told them. “They wanted a different White.”</p>
			<p>Jack chuckled. “They really on the ball, ain’t they?”</p>
			<p>Less than half an hour later came the shakedown.</p>
			<p>The door banged open. Five or six guards swarmed in. “Get your shoes and blues on, and go out in the hall!” one announced in the same tones he might have used to say, “This is a bust!”&#9;</p>
			<p>“This is a routine shakedown,” another explained in a calmer voice.</p>
			<p>I had my shoes on already – one must put them on for any trip out into the hall, including classes, gym, or visits – so I went out into the hall. There we were lined up, braced against the wall (you know “the position” – you’ve seen it on TV a thousand times), and searched, hands running up and down our bodies. Some of us were told to take off our shoes and socks and show the soles of our feet, but I was not. As each of us was searched we were told to go up to the gym, which was empty. We played basketball there – and Mike and I each ran a hundred laps around the room – while our cellblock and individual cells were searched. After about half an hour we were returned to A-7.</p>
			<p>Things were missing. Sandwiches saved from lunch were gone. The day’s Fairfax Journal was gone (small loss). A box in which Jack kept his things was gone, everything that had been in it dumped unceremoniously out on the floor. But left-over potato chips, still in their bags, remained in plain sight. I’d noticed my smaller mattress in the hall. Peering through the window in my cell door, I could see my room was disordered, but not what might be missing.</p>
			<p>Jack had worn his shower shoes out. They’d taken his tennis shoes – but did bring them back. The dayroom looked emptier.</p>
			<p>After our cells were unlocked, I inventoried my room. Books were all there – in a pile on my bed. My Commissary goods – candy, cookies – were still there. So, amazingly, was the bag of hard-boiled eggs from breakfast (saved for a night-time snack). But the bag with folded up paper bags (in which things had come from Commissary) and a foam cup (rare contraband, left by Wayne) was gone. My letters were mixed up, those I’d kept separate because I’d not yet answered them, and those from Lynda, mixed in with the others. The neatly folded sheet of newspaper Wayne had left as “shelf paper” on the top of my tiny “desk” was gone. So also was the folded-up chunk of newspaper I used to keep my cell door from locking (when I wanted privacy in the evening without locking myself in).</p>
			<p>My bed is now hard as a rock – or, more accurately, concrete.</p>
			<p>#</p>
			<p>Joe [a new man, whose arrival I edited out] still refuses to sleep after breakfast, but bangs around and keeps the rest of us, except Chester, awake. “What do I need with all that sleep?” he asked belligerently. “Ain’t nothing to do in here, anyway! Don’t need more than four or five hours!”</p>
			<p>But for two nights now, he’s been crashing – directly under the phone, making access to it difficult – in the early evening, around six or six-thirty, lying on his back and snoring loudly.</p>
			<p>“Superman!” Jack snorted to Mike, with a nod at Joe.</p>
