              <h1>Letters From Jail #7</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 28, 1986</h2>
			<p>At the end of this week, I will have been here a month. And it’s starting to get to me: The tedium, the basic unrelenting banal boredom.</p>
			<p>It’s Sunday, and the TV has been football all afternoon. Football – on TV – bores me. It’s repetitious and unreal, full of intense commentary and crowd noises, and totally ephemeral. When one game ends there is another, back to back, stealing away whatever sense of uniqueness a single game might have. And during one of the interminable breaks in the action of one game, “highlights” – looking exactly the same – from another one are shown. Football for the sake of football; meaningless action that adds up to nothing except a list of final scores.</p>
			<p>Earlier, before lunch, we played three games of Spades. Phil and I (as partners) won all three, but mostly because we were dealt better hands – I had trouble concentrating on the games.</p>
			<p>You can only play so much cards. You can only read so many books. You can only sit around for so long. Lonny and I have been pacing back and forth. It’s five o’clock. Where’s the food? Where’s supper? (And – will it be any good?)</p>
			<p>I read Paul Williams’ Only Apparently Real, correcting the typos with this pen, wondering if my contributions to the Phil Dick Myth would be acknowledged (they weren’t, even in discussions of the publishing history of a work I exhumed from his agent’s files, after years of lying fallow), comforted in this only by the omissions of Calvin Demmon (an almost-collaborator of Phil’s), Ray Nelson, and Roger Zelazny (actual collaborators). Paul’s view of Phil Dick doesn’t include most of his ’60s friends and associates, nor the possibility that Phil could collaborate with anyone else (Phil is too unique, too much the property of his ’70s friends now). But despite the unbalanced focus of the book (was that 1971 break-in that important? More important than Phil’s 1974 conversion to Christianity and its effects on his subsequent work?), and the coy way Paul turns himself into a work of art (Phil’s art), there are insights to be gleaned, almost inferentially, from the book, and the book does evoke the Phil Dick Experience. </p>
			<p>The major insight is one Paul appears not to recognize: Phil had a very poor grasp on his own reality, and almost unfailingly Got It Wrong when relating his experiences with others, especially editors, agents, and publishers. Virtually every story he tells about his experiences is suspect, a point Paul verifies the one time he checks one out with Phil’s agent’s records. Few of Phil’s scurrilous stories about his editors are given, but Terry Carr alone is named – unfairly in this respect, which is a shame, since Terry was one of his most sympathetic editors.</p>
			<p>Still. It was engrossing reading, and filled in a lot of factual and chronological details, lending context to my own (1964–72) experiences of the man. (Maybe my sourness today is influencing my reaction to the book as well.)</p>
			<p>At first the Jail Experience is new – there are new things to be found out, new people to be met – but after a while you begin to realize that the essence of the Jail Experience is the dull sameness of each day, one after the next. Small differences assume great importance: The nature of each meal, the arrival of fresh mail, a visitor, a class. Little things get on your nerves, like one man’s unfailingly bad jokes, or another’s cackling laugh. The very predictability of these things get to you.</p>
			<p>Supper was better than usual: “steak” – overcooked to falling-apart tenderness (just as well, since the only eating utensil is a plastic spoon); mashed potatoes with gravy, string beans, salad (“French” dressing), and butterscotch pudding, with lemonade. I ate it all, giving away only the redundant two slices of white bread.</p>
			<p>I took a break from Paul’s book to write the second installment of the serial I have been running in Lee Hoffman’s Science-Fiction Five-Yearly. It was inspired by Phil Dick (as was the first installment, written in 1981), and suddenly I felt the desire to write it. That’s the first non-letter (or non-Letter) writing I’ve done here. It makes me wonder if I can – or should – try writing some “real” fiction here. I’ve resisted it up to now, mostly because of my impatience with hand-writing – which, among other things, cramps my hand and leaves a groove in my middle finger.</p>
			<p>They just unlocked our cells, and I’ve moved inside to write this on my “desk.” It’s a lot easier than my lap.</p>
			<p>I’ve had several days to get used to this cell now. I “enjoy” it in the sense of having a place for my things, privacy, a place to nap in the evenings, etc., but there are liabilities. The major one is remembering everything I want to take out with me in the morning. Wayne used to forget his cigarettes, or, on laundry days (Sundays and Wednesdays), his personal laundry (underwear, socks). I have to be sure I have the letters I want to answer, the books I want to read, and the snacks (hardboiled eggs left over from an earlier breakfast, sandwiches, or commissary candy) I may want to eat. I usually make a pile of these things the night before, adding to it as I think of things. But the anxiety stays with me each time: Have I forgotten something? (Like everything else, I expect this will eventually become a boring routine – until I mess up.)</p>
			<p>The air-conditioning in here makes the individual cells colder than the dayroom. The hotter it is outside, the colder it is in here. Last night I slept with most of my clothes on.</p>
			<p>I’m not sure there’s much more to describe about life here. Surely most of what is yet to come will be a dull recital of menus, interleaved with my reactions to the books I’ve most recently read: boring stuff. Who cares if Bill (the 62 year old) is from New England originally, and that I guessed this from his accent (which stands out in contrast to the accents of the rest of us here)? Or that Chester is 51 – making me (at 48) only the third oldest, instead of the oldest in here? These are petty details indeed – worthy of Michael Ashley’s puny contempt.</p>
			<p>So what’s left for future Letters? Shall I delve Into Weighty Philosophizing? Or relate the tidbits of gossip which come my way via phone and letters? (Dan Steffan finally landed a really decent job as the Art Director of a slick Washington, D.C. monthly, and will get to redesign it; the Jerry Jacks Estate is being settled somewhat more decently than I’d feared from first reports; my daughter is not only bearing up well on her own, her grades are improving and she’s gaining more friends….)</p>
			<p>I need to maintain this channel of communication, mostly to keep some sense of direction to my life in here, but simultaneously I worry about running out of things to say, and about writing too much, too frequently, clogging the channels with verbiage.</p>
			<p>I guess I’ll have to start on that novel.</p>
