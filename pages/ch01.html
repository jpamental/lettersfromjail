              <h1>Letters From Jail #1</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>September 6, 1986</h2>
			<p>“This man has a sixties mentality,” the female prosecutor said. And, unstated, “He ought to be punished for it.”</p>
			<p>“You may think the drugs you sold were not harmful,” Judge Jennings said, “but they inevitably lead to worse ones.” What era mentality is that?</p>
			<p>The judge pronounced the sentence: “Ten years of incarceration” – I stood very still – “with nine suspended.”</p>
			<p>One year. Or less. How much less I do not yet know. Estimates I’ve heard range from 45 days to six months.</p>
			<p>I was taken directly from the courtroom to a cell outside and was told by a deputy that I would serve my sentence there (here) at the Adult Detention Center, a jail in Fairfax City. </p>
			<p>Then he left me in a concrete cell for an hour while my paperwork was processed.</p>
			<p>From there I was taken downstairs via private passages to G(eneral) H(olding) 2 – the same cell I’d shared with around 20 drunks the night of my arrest in March. I sat on a concrete bench for about three hours with 18 others – some of whom would be processed with me in the days to come.</p>
			<p>Later that afternoon I was taken to a receiving cell – R44 – where I spent Friday night, Saturday, and part of Sunday. It was hellish.</p>

			<p>Imagine a concrete cell ten feet high, seven feet wide, and eight feet deep. A bench-shelf ran across the &#9;back wall, and – thank ghod – had a thin mattress on it. In the corner to the right of the door was a stainless steel commode/toilet. A fluorescent light overhead was lit 24 hours. The door had a barred window and a slot which opened to admit trays of “food.” (Pig swill is a better description.) With rare exceptions, when I was taken out for “classification,” etc., I spent my time in that windowless cell doing nothing, allowed nothing to read. I dozed much of that time, escaping reality in vague dreams, punctuated by noises from the corridor outside and cells down the way. It was air-conditioned, and uncomfortably cold. There was no blanket, no pillow. Eventually my body ached in every position.</p>
			<p>Around 3 AM, Sunday morning, I was taken to a room where I surrendered all my clothes – my watch and everything in my pockets had already been taken – showered, and was issued my prison clothes, rather old and threadbare.</p>
			<p>From there I was taken to DT-2, a cell-block where I was given a cellroom off the dayroom. It was larger and nicer than R44 – in addition to a separate commode and toilet, it had a table and lights that dimmed at night, and I was issued two sheets (very thin) and a blanket (ratty and too short).</p>
			<p>This began a less unpleasant existence. I didn’t sleep much the rest of that night – I was slept out – but the surroundings were better.</p>
			<p>Around 5 AM the lights came on, my cell door unlocked with a loud bang, and I rose to join eight others in the dayroom for breakfast. I gave my stainless-steel tray of swill to the others and returned to my bed. At 9 AM I had to leave my cell for the dayroom – my cell door was locked and my cell inaccessible until evening.</p>
			<p>The others in the dayroom were four whites and four blacks. I recognized several from GH-2 – two had gone in with me that morning.</p>
			<p>I found it easy to make friends with all of them, and soon began playing cards with them. (I played Spades with “spades.”) Jesse was a tall black with a motor-mouth – a line of jive and clever with cards. He christened me Theo. (I am officially Theodore White here.) Rick Washington was a soft-spoken black with whom I became friends. The whites stayed more by themselves that day. I found my accent thickening as I spent most of my time with the blacks.</p>
			<p>The day (Sunday) passed quickly and enjoyably. We played cards, the food got better, and I found myself smiling to myself in bed that night. This isn’t that bad, I thought to myself.</p>
			<p>Half of us were transferred to permanent cells in the general population that evening – the rest of us to follow 24 hours later. During the “night,” three new ones were added.</p>
			<p>Monday morning I rose for breakfast feeling pretty good. The day passed with card games – something I always enjoy – and conversation. I used the phone (collect outgoing calls only) to talk to my mother and my daughter. A minister came by and gave us pencils and paper.</p>
			<p>Around 9 PM five of us were transferred “upstairs.” I was separated from my newfound friends and put in Cellblock A-5.</p>
			<p>This is a smaller cellblock than DT-2. The dayroom is smaller, and there are only four separate cells off of it. (DT-2 had six.) There are seven of us here, and as the newest I sleep on the floor of the dayroom with two others. No privacy at all. This does not strike me as an improvement. But we have a TV set (13 B&amp;W), cards, etc. Four blacks and three whites, all “older men” like me.</p>
			<p>When I came in, everyone was watching Monday Night Football, so I haven’t really “met” most of them yet. (Instead, I’ve written this.) I’ve yet to settle into the routine here, but I hope I’ll move up to a cell eventually. I’ll keep you posted.</p>
